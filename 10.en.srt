1
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,001
Miss.

2
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,803
The office of student affairs is about to close.

3
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,605
Why are you reading alone here?

4
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,475
President.

5
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,944
Can I borrow this book and bring it home with me?

6
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,781
[2011, Ming Ren University]
"The Name of the Rose"?

7
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,681
[2011, Ming Ren University]
Sure.

8
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,283
Just that the novels written by Eco

9
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,818
are all like encyclopedias.

10
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,353
They're difficult to digest.

11
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,725
But the only one who can turn a mystery novel

12
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,262
into a study on culture in the European Middle Ages

13
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,230
should be him.

14
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:07,834
For this experiment,

15
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,769
we will test three different liquids

16
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,439
and find out the rate of dissolution for each liquid.

17
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,307
How long has it been?

18
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,543
Forty seconds.

19
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,344
After forty seconds, the tap water hasn't...

20
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,280
Cola has the biggest reaction.

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,882
The test for vertical drip stain starts now.

22
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,420
You captured me in the photo as well.

23
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,759
You won the first prize!

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,594
Classmate, see,

25
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,728
do you know who she is?

26
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:36,996
A genius novelist.

27
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,866
She will be a genius novelist in the future...Chang Ching Yu.

28
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,060
[The smell of baby oil...]

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,094
[In an abandoned factory...]

30
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,597
[No one was there, no one. Chen Wei, where are you?]

31
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,266
[I feel dirty...]

32
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:32,512
[Episode 10: The Name of the Rose]

33
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,685
You are "Ghost".

34
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,356
Did you see the violin string on the floor?

35
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,160
Pick it up and kill him.

36
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,767
If you don't do it,

37
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,839
you will die.

38
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,921
Why are you doing this to me?

39
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,556
What did I do to upset you?

40
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,959
Do you still remember who Chang Ching Yu is?

41
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,701
She's my older sister.

42
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,473
Don't tell me you've forgotten how you treated her, right?

43
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,359
I think this summer...

44
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,460
I won't follow you

45
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,696
to America for short-term studies for now.

46
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,837
Why? We already agreed...

47
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,476
and my dad insisted that I have to go.

48
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,845
Even if you don't go, I still have to.

49
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,081
So you go first.

50
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,350
I'll go another time.

51
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,185
Wait for me to save up enough money.

52
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,555
How are you going to save up enough money?

53
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,691
Work.

54
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,860
Hello.

55
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:32,565
Could I ask if you're still recruiting assistants?

56
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,371
My surname is Chang.

57
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,075
Chang Ching Yu.

58
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,556
Is anyone here? I'm here to...

59
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,945
Were you sleeping?

60
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,514
There's someone at the door, see whether she wants to report a case.

61
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,816
You're such a...

62
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,718
You know what happened next.

63
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,595
After it happened,

64
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,865
I saw how devastated my older sister was.

65
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,334
I heard her calling and begging you.

66
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,236
Begging you to talk to her.

67
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,512
Do you know what kind of sister she was?

68
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,949
How could this happen?

69
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,651
Look at what you are wearing.

70
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,853
I've told you before.

71
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,921
A girl is like a hole.

72
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,089
All sorts of rubbish

73
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,891
will fall into the hole.

74
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,093
How could you be so careless?

75
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,995
Look at what you are like now.

76
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,698
A girl like you

77
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,670
is useless, why did we have you?

78
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,005
Go back to your room.

79
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,808
Still looking at me!

80
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,692
Sister, you're back.

81
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,226
Yes.

82
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,761
Is it your school holiday?

83
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,064
I prepared presents for you.

84
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,432
Brother, yours.

85
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,102
Yours is on the bed.

86
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,339
PSP?

87
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,842
Thank you sister, I'm going to go play now.

88
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,279
Sister, this is very expensive.

89
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,881
Don't you like writing?

90
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,217
You can use this laptop to write from now on.

91
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,086
I have another gift for you.

92
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,489
More?

93
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,358
I spent a long time choosing.

94
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,097
Wearing it is like

95
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,198
I'm next to you.

96
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,867
Like an amulet.

97
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,002
Thank you sister.

98
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,938
Why do you look so silly when you smile?

99
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,807
What's gotten into you today?

100
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,842
Why are you so nice to us?

101
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,811
I'm usually nice to you.

102
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,714
I'm going to hurry up and check on my laptop.

103
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,285
From now on, don't think too much of what mom and dad say.

104
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,588
Even if they love our younger brother more,

105
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,024
don't take it out on him.

106
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,060
Sister, time for dinner.

107
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,505
Sister.

108
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:10,943
Sister.

109
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:16,282
Sister.

110
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,185
Sister.

111
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,499
ADA (Assistant District Attorney), this way please.

112
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,799
It's here.

113
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,833
Coming.

114
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:24,884
Yang,

115
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,886
give this to the digital forensics team immediately.

116
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,953
No problem.

117
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,907
They blocked the drain with this

118
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,709
so that the rainwater couldn't flow out.

119
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,411
Did anyone leave in the middle of the gathering?

120
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,314
I only remember that they left for the toilet.

121
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,183
At most it wouldn't have exceeded five minutes.

122
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,718
But for those who are familiar with this place, to do these things,

123
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,985
five minutes should be enough.

124
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,358
Who are you? Don't run!

125
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,526
Don't touch me.

126
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,895
Don't touch me!

127
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,598
You are Chang Ting Lan's younger brother.

128
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,033
Where is she?

129
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,069
I don't know.

130
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,570
Call her now.

131
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,173
Why should I listen to you?

132
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,141
Your sister is in a lot of trouble.

133
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,375
Please cooperate with us.

134
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,859
I really regretted it.

135
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,362
I really wish my sister had never known you.

136
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,932
Were it not for you,

137
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,102
she wouldn't have loathed herself so much.

138
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,141
People like you who are

139
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,910
so well taken care of...

140
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,211
You had no idea how worried she was

141
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,979
that she couldn't go abroad with you.

142
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,148
I knew.

143
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,951
It will definitely be a difficult time.

144
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,022
When a girl encounters this type of situation,

145
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,825
it will be difficult for her to recover psychologically for the rest of her life.

146
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,727
I've seen it too many times.

147
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,263
The best method

148
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,766
is for both of you to stay apart for a while

149
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,434
to calm down.

150
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,336
You must hold back.

151
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,172
Didn't something happen to her previously?

152
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,575
President, Senior Ching Yu is here.

153
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,242
If that happened to me,

154
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,077
I wouldn't dare to come here.

155
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,020
You should be preparing to take the bar exams, right?

156
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,156
As a legal professional,

157
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,159
whether you are a lawyer, DA (District Attorney) or judge,

158
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,661
it is easy for the parties involved to take everything out on you

159
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,030
and because of that, you become involved in the dispute.

160
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,268
If your wife's records have such areas of concern,

161
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,103
I'm afraid that your future career

162
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,938
will suffer.

163
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,449
Can you please say something?

164
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,256
Anything is fine.

165
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,058
Twenty-eight calls. He didn't say a word throughout each call. I cried again...as I cried I asked him...can you please say something?

166
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,695
[Why...Chen Wei knows. I could only cry, I couldn't say anything...I realised that there's no use in crying. No use...everything is gone. I thought I could go overseas, study...I thought Chen Wei would understand...]

167
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:02,167
[I woke up very early today, the weather was good. I decided to go out and buy gifts for Lan and Hon.]

168
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,271
[Am I a good sister? Am I a person who is still intact?]

169
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,908
You knew how he sexually assaulted her,

170
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,611
how it felt to be toyed with and captured in indecent photos.

171
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,246
Where were you?

172
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,684
What did you do when she needed you the most?

173
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,019
Why?

174
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,954
Why did my older sister still care about

175
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,156
whether you could handle the humiliation?

176
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,464
Senior.

177
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,734
Sorry.

178
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,805
I really despise you.

179
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,543
Goose, here.

180
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,345
Lan.

181
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,680
Don't come here.

182
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,482
Don't come here!

183
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,424
Lan.

184
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,758
Okay, we...

185
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,961
We know what happened. You--

186
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,063
Put down the phone.

187
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,141
Senior Yun Wen.

188
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,847
I'm really grateful to you.

189
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:28,153
If not for him, I may not have been able to find the culprit.

190
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,490
I'm going to the toilet.

191
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,599
Come home earlier.

192
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,334
Okay, don't wait for me.

193
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,806
Is Gi here today?

194
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,475
No, he hasn't come for a long time.

195
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,944
I thought I could meet him if I came here today.

196
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,345
Do you remember who he is?

197
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,090
Excuse me, I wanted to ask

198
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,059
whether I can make an appointment to see Doctor Wen now?

199
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,329
The earliest appointment for Doctor Wen is next Wednesday.

200
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,864
Next Wednesday?

201
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:14,900
Driver, help me get closer to that car.

202
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,735
["The Doctor's Room"]

203
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,744
Go there.

204
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,257
It's your turn to take action.

205
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,595
You said you want to find the culprit.

206
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,797
I've found the culprit for you!

207
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,965
Why don't you hurry up and take action?

208
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,212
Senior. Senior!

209
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,246
You can't.

210
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,815
Be careful!

211
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,319
Senior!

212
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,353
Get lost!

213
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,266
Calm down.

214
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,434
Senior.

215
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:22,901
You can't.

216
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,536
Calm down!

217
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,904
You can't!

218
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,639
You can't.

219
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,340
Calm down.

220
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,041
No.

221
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,309
You can't.

222
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,844
Let the law take its course, okay?

223
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,313
We'll let the law take its course!

224
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,714
Senior!

225
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,316
You can't!

226
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,364
Can you please say something?

227
00:18:56,568 --> 00:19:01,173
I know you feel as upset as I do.

228
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,549
Dad, I've thought about it

229
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,118
and I'm very calm now.

230
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,187
There's nothing wrong with going to see her for a bit.

231
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,560
If you are full,

232
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,461
go help Auntie Lu

233
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,630
move the box of books that Uncle Liang borrowed

234
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,165
to my room first.

235
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,800
[Where are you? I'll go find you later.]

236
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,243
What are you doing?

237
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,914
Open the door!

238
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,282
Why can't you calm down

239
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,716
and think it through?

240
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,353
"Think" my ass!

241
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,024
Open the door!

242
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,798
I'm sorry.

243
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:08,473
I'm sorry.

244
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,651
Yes.

245
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,490
What happened to Chang Ching Yu is in the past.

246
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,493
Now you just want to protect this senior

247
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,096
who was supposed to have a bright future ahead of him.

248
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,898
It's not like that Lan.

249
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you know why they wrote "To Be Loved"?

250
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,074
Because Goose was secretly in love with you.

251
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,811
She didn't want to see you fall into depression.

252
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,949
Senior Yun Wen as well.

253
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:54,086
He envies you for having a father who is a judge.

254
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,120
You know how much he hoped that

255
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,722
the father and son would reconcile and

256
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,290
the prodigal son would return home,

257
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,224
ending up with a bright future.

258
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,292
- Isn't that true, Senior Yun Wen?
- No.

259
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,194
It's not like that, Lan.

260
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,963
No.

261
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,938
After what happened to Senior Ching Yu,

262
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,111
I went to the police station with you all.

263
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,146
I got a shock because...

264
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,850
because the cop you wanted to hit,

265
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,218
Kuo Chung Ren,

266
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,657
was my mom's ex-boyfriend.

267
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,794
As you all know, because...

268
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,729
because my dad passed away a long time ago,

269
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,198
so my mom opened a hair salon.

270
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,334
But she kept getting harassed by hooligans.

271
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,969
Kuo Chung Ren was a cop

272
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,673
so he helped my mom a lot.

273
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,677
After he got together with my mom,

274
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,345
he also often hit my mom.

275
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,549
Until the last time,

276
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,385
when he beat my mom until she had to go to the hospital,

277
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,055
my mom made up her mind to break up with him.

278
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,425
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,394
I'm sorry.

280
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,030
I'm sorry.

281
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,566
I didn't dare to say it then...I didn't dare.

282
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,236
I'm sorry, I...

283
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,807
I didn't dare...I didn't dare to tell you.

284
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:22,808
That bastard policeman.

285
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,743
That garbage cop.

286
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,479
He was...

287
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,781
He was once considered my stepdad.

288
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,224
What is the point of talking about all these now?

289
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,360
I...

290
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,828
Yes, we all worshiped you in university.

291
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,896
Because...

292
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:45,897
because your family background was very good.

293
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,999
Because your family background was very good,

294
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,202
everything about you was good.

295
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,037
We all revolve around you,

296
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,340
thinking that you have everything.

297
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,476
But after graduation,

298
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,343
we were all busy with our own jobs

299
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,245
and problems.

300
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,382
But I couldn't understand why...

301
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,016
why you wouldn't listen to your dad?

302
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,686
Why didn't you choose law...why...

303
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,987
why do I see you

304
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,490
sleep in the mystery bookstore every time?

305
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,025
I really couldn't understand why, so...

306
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,228
so we

307
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,364
put our inferiority complex

308
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,799
and...

309
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,000
and everything that we could imagine...

310
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,202
The ugliness of humanity

311
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,471
the sufferings of life

312
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,372
onto a fictional judge

313
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,574
and his son.

314
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,546
Lan.

315
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,249
Lan.

316
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,250
Please.

317
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,853
Please don't.

318
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,894
Lan.

319
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,629
Let me help you.

320
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,596
No, Lan!

321
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,503
ADA.

322
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,405
The digital forensics team has cracked the password.

323
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,139
There's only

324
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,841
one application, Telegram, in the phone.

325
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,209
The contents of the chats are still in there.

326
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,644
Do you want to take a look?

327
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,385
So cute.

328
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,823
I'm your favorite kitty.

329
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,224
That's right.

330
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,725
Do you like it?

331
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,294
Hi.

332
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,286
This is your older sister's phone.

333
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,287
Have you seen it before?

334
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,559
We found it in her laboratory.

335
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,595
She used Telegram pornography group chats which are illegal

336
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,965
to seduce her victims and kill them once they take the bait.

337
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,600
Did you assist her?

338
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,873
Look closely.

339
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,141
These chat records prove

340
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,877
that after she met many people online,

341
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,311
she went out with them in person.

342
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,649
What do you think they did when they met?

343
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,684
A girl meeting a sex offender alone.

344
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,053
What method do you think she used to subdue them?

345
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,569
Bend down.

346
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,106
Bend down! You don't understand what I'm saying?

347
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,607
You asked to meet.

348
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,143
You asked to meet yet you're still resisting.

349
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,946
You whore.

350
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,714
Watch how I tie you up today.

351
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,884
Bend down!

352
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,221
Watch how I destroy you today.

353
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,459
I didn't know.

354
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,364
Sister.

355
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,500
I'm going to go buy food, do you want some?

356
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,404
No need.

357
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,739
Why did you lock the door?

358
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,287
I didn't know.

359
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,592
I knew nothing.

360
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,029
I didn't know.

361
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,804
I didn't know.

362
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,238
Not that wet already?

363
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,008
Sister.

364
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,978
You just want me to destroy you, right?

365
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,182
I didn't know.

366
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,869
Breaking news.

367
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,405
A live streamer broke into an abandoned factory

368
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,539
and found a dead body.

369
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,408
The dead person is surprisingly

370
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,144
the entrepreneur who has been missing for nearly a month,

371
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,278
Ku Yu Hon.

372
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,680
At 3 am, a live streamer

373
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,282
went to an abandoned factory to explore

374
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,617
and instantly became terrified.

375
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,053
His friend initially thought that he had done it to spice things up.

376
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,389
- To his surprise, they had genuinely discovered a dead body.
- Hurry up, Hurry up.

377
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,224
- Based on an analysis of the dead body,
- See who took the tray for notes, the first one...

378
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,458
- the dead person is
- The first one, Zhen Jun Ning.

379
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,395
- Hao Yu Precision Company's
- Here.

380
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,963
chairman who has been missing for many days, Ku Yu Hon.

381
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,632
The time of death matches the time he was reported missing.

382
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,100
Because there are no traces of a struggle at the crime scene

383
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,403
and a suicide note was left behind Yu Ku Hon's body,

384
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,471
the police have determined that it is likely to be a suicide case.

385
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,641
Son, he's even a big shot.

386
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,243
Pervert.

387
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,146
Do you deal with this kind of thing a lot outside?

388
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,715
He confessed to many serial rapes.

389
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,616
When his company received the news,

390
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,819
his employees and personnel expressed their disbelief

391
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,954
because Ku Yu Hon had a good public image before his death

392
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,389
and he was actively involved in charity events.

393
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,691
Therefore, some of the staff questioned

394
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,826
the authenticity of this confession note.

395
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,661
But if the contents of the confession note are true,

396
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,929
this means that all these years,

397
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,764
his refined and good-natured appearance

398
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,100
concealed a terrifying and evil wolf who

399
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,402
devilishly targeted minors.

400
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,912
For this case, based on all the evidence that

401
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,114
the DA has submitted,

402
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,050
the defendant Chang Ting Lan,

403
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:44,222
on the charges of murdering Chen Chin Peng and Chen Shen Ho,

404
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,624
is found guilty of murder

405
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,893
and sentenced to life imprisonment.

406
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,597
Does the defendant

407
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,699
have anything to say about the verdict?

408
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,206
I...

409
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,848
I actually imagined myself standing here before

410
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,487
many times.

411
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,628
Once I receive the verdict,

412
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,833
I won't need to hide anymore.

413
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,437
I can tell the truth.

414
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,743
Two years ago,

415
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,114
Bye.

416
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,955
When I was investigating who raped my sister,

417
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,794
I wasn't careful and ended up being sexually assaulted by an ex-offender.

418
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,036
I didn't tell anyone.

419
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:19,644
From then on,

420
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,780
I decided to kill

421
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,216
all those who committed sexual assault and the perpetrators

422
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,520
Because they can't be cured.

423
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,727
I've already used my experience to show everyone

424
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,563
that this is reality.

425
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,132
Hurry up and your medicine.

426
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,869
Take your medicine, okay, take your medicine.

427
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,408
[I can make it tonight, where do we meet?]

428
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,181
Stop taking pictures.

429
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,417
Here...it's your turn.

430
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,019
Mister Chen Shen Ho?

431
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:01,786
Yes.

432
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,454
Someone asked me to give you this.

433
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,723
I learned to make your favourite cinnamon rolls specifically for you.

434
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,625
Hope you like them.

435
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,527
Enjoy them with the bag of tea.

436
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,009
Hello, where are you?

437
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,678
I've already reached.

438
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,080
Don't appear only after I've finished drinking.

439
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,517
Chen Chin Peng.

440
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,553
I'm almost done drinking, you only just reached.

441
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:36,621
It took you so long.

442
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,157
I brought this to make it up to you.

443
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,291
Try drinking it.

444
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,962
I've drunk this before, it's extremely delicious.

445
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,731
I want to try doing it at the beach today.

446
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,537
Even though our society

447
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,673
values human rights more,

448
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,742
it's only for the perpetrators.

449
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,544
Not for the victims.

450
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,747
If one person

451
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,917
really must step up

452
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,318
and do something,

453
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,656
maybe it could be me.

454
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:16,361
I didn't want to be a weak victim

455
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:22,000
begging the judiciary to protect me again.

456
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,305
I wanted them to know

457
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,808
that there is a price to be paid for doing that kind of thing.

458
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,611
Defendant Chang Ting Lan, are you admitting that

459
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,146
besides Chen Chin Peng and the other victim,

460
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,048
you have killed more people?

461
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,317
Lan.

462
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,885
You don't need to answer.

463
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:42,854
Silence.

464
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,961
This court has already made its judgment.

465
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,562
The defendant's comments

466
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,031
will not be recorded.

467
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,434
Court is adjourned.

468
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:51,923
Wen Tsu Yen.

469
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,693
Hurry up.

470
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,402
Go.

471
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,440
Hi.

472
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,009
Hi.

473
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,845
Is there a reason why you suddenly came to find me?

474
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,614
No.

475
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,016
Sorry for appearing so suddenly.

476
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,653
Just...

477
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,557
I came here because I wanted to tell you that

478
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,427
I'm just a

479
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,362
truck driver.

480
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,767
I realized...

481
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:40,037
I realised I don't seem to be

482
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,372
worthy of you.

483
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,459
Goose.

484
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,736
Do you know?

485
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,973
You are very important to me.

486
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,745
You're back.

487
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,247
When I was a kid, whenever I went home,

488
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,016
there would be no one at home.

489
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,053
Even if there were,

490
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,255
they and my mom would never notice me.

491
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,693
But that day when I went home,

492
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:39,864
I realized

493
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,533
that this seems to be what it's like to have a family.

494
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,403
That...I think these curtains are very pretty.

495
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,638
Thank you...I like them a lot.

496
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,574
Let me tell you, I've never...

497
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,008
never bought anything like this.

498
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,414
As long as you like them.

499
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:57,815
I know that I previously

500
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,518
did many bad things.

501
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,621
I don't make a lot of money

502
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,256
and don't have much education as well.

503
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,693
But I really hope that

504
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,129
when I go home in the future,

505
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,899
I can still see you when I open the door.

506
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,771
Because you were the one who helped me realise

507
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,741
that someone as lousy as me

508
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,043
deserves to be loved too.

509
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,811
I don't know why.

510
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,114
When Lan didn't appeal,

511
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,615
I felt a bit regretful.

512
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,656
Because of what she said at the end?

513
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,925
Maybe because I can understand her quite well.

514
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,596
But regarding the taxi murder,

515
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,297
the DA determined that

516
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,465
only Chen Chin Peng was involved.

517
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,301
There's nothing I can do.

518
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,970
Otherwise what do you think happened?

519
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,473
Lan didn't tell you, right?

520
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,243
But I can guess that

521
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,978
you have your own opinions.

522
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,251
How about

523
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,222
you say yours first?

524
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,761
Two weeks before the murder,

525
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,129
Kuo Chung Ren's neighbor said that

526
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,331
there were weird noises continuously coming out from his house.

527
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,032
Based on this,

528
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,968
I think Lan used a very high frequency

529
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,471
to torture Kuo Chung Ren.

530
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,517
After killing Kuo Chung Ren,

531
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,119
Lan snuck into the bookstore

532
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,954
and poked a hole in the pipe above the computer desk

533
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,356
Cheers.

534
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,992
with the design to make you leave the bookstore.

535
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,462
On the day of the murder, she took advantage of the moment when everyone was distracted

536
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,498
to secretly climb to the attic and block the drain.

537
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,740
Senior, it's leaking inside as well.

538
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,774
Why is it leaking again?

539
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:37,608
The ceiling.

540
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,744
Help me to take the rag out.

541
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,312
Senior, you're still not leaving?

542
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,148
I want to write more.

543
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,082
I still don't know what surprise

544
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,984
the "Ghost" has in store for me after eight hours.

545
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:52,823
My conjecture is that

546
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,059
Chen Chin Peng was the one who drove Lan to the scene.

547
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,961
At the same time, she needed to know when you left.

548
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,296
So Lan asked her younger brother to go to the bookstore and monitor you.

549
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,845
Hello sister, he's leaving.

550
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,080
Okay I got it.

551
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,415
Okay...is this alright?

552
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,684
Sister, what are you doing?

553
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,154
You don't need to bother too much, hurry up and go home.

554
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:24,889
Sister.

555
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,433
Take the canvas bag with you.

556
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,901
I'll call you later.

557
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:40,204
I'm leaving.

558
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,108
There were very few bloodstains on the windshield.

559
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,043
This means that he was already dead at the time.

560
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,078
His left finger was already chopped off at his house.

561
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,014
Using the violin string to strangle him

562
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,916
was just to frame you.

563
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,141
Hey!

564
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:18,876
Stop driving!

565
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,245
Stop driving!

566
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,739
How did you know

567
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,774
that those things were in my car trunk?

568
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:52,943
The day after the murder,

569
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,012
you went to a self-service car wash to wash your car.

570
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,548
The surveillance camera filmed you tidying up your car trunk.

571
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,453
So...

572
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,622
you had the murder weapon from start to end, right?

573
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:09,960
Don't worry.

574
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,263
I said that I only want to play a mystery game.

575
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,864
You are a victim too.

576
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,332
There's nothing to investigate.

577
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,170
Won't this be against your work ethic?

578
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,139
Actually I plan to quit my job.

579
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,309
In the judicial system,

580
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,811
ADAs can only follow the commands of the DAs.

581
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,380
It really doesn't suit me.

582
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,249
What job do you want to change to then?

583
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,552
I'm still not sure.

584
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,989
But Lan's case got me to re-consider

585
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,624
whether working for the prosecution

586
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,860
is the best option

587
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,461
for me to achieve my idea of justice.

588
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,768
I may judge someone to be guilty

589
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:51,969
but I've completely neglected

590
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,737
the complex reasons

591
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,539
behind his commission of the crime.

592
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,443
I may judge someone to be innocent

593
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,078
merely because he's cunning enough

594
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,947
not to leave behind any evidence.

595
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,752
If you think about it this way,

596
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,854
those who work in the judicial system

597
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,657
are responsible for so many lives.

598
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,725
But I can only use my limited

599
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,193
opinions and insights

600
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,329
to decide on some matters.

601
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,265
The weight behind these decisions

602
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,400
is not something that I can bear.

603
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,872
No wonder you all like to talk about misjudged cases in Taiwan.

604
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,679
My dad is a judge, right?

605
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,384
I was tidying up his belongings recently

606
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,419
and found a notebook that he used to write in.

607
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,154
It was his diary.

608
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,826
In it he wrote

609
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,695
about all his thoughts and opinions on cases.

610
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:57,434
He only mentioned me and my mom occasionally.

611
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,271
Working in the judicial system

612
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,407
is really a lifetime commitment.

613
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,210
But he was really happy doing it.

614
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,216
I heard from Yun Wen that you intend to take the bar exam.

615
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,051
Yes.

616
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,420
I mainly want to help Lan.

617
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,590
Life sentence is too severe a punishment.

618
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,225
It's not worth it for those people.

619
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:23,527
Now I only hope that

620
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,396
I can study in peace.

621
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,798
I feel the same way too.

622
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,301
How about I take the bar exam with you?

623
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,744
Are you serious?

624
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,746
It's highly efficient to study with someone

625
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,050
and being a lawyer feels good.

626
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,121
Then...it's a deal.

627
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,058
The roses on the meadow

628
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,729
are proudly showing off

629
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,534
the coquettish scarlet and bright red colours.

630
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,673
The lovely grassland,

631
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,608
the lush vegetation.

632
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,544
It's a pity that you're beautiful

633
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,319
yet unfortunate.

634
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,757
The Name of the Rose.

635
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,925
was Senior Ching Yu's favorite book.

636
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,229
Senior.

637
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,765
The fact that Lan asked you to help

638
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,833
should mean that she has already put the past behind her

639
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,502
and doesn't blame you anymore, right?

640
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,704
I suppose so.

641
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:19,676
When is the next time

642
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,612
we will see Lan?

643
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,547
The earliest should be after one or two years.

644
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,648
Maybe by then,

645
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:25,916
she would already have become

646
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,418
a veteran leader at that time.

647
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,787
Right, she will definitely say,

648
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,422
"Do it! Do it!"

649
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,891
Stop messing around.

650
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,460
I think she has a lot of potential.

651
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,561
Yes.

652
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,330
I don't know what she'll do

653
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,598
in prison.

654
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,067
Does she have mystery novels to read?

655
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,869
Or should we record

656
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,938
podcasts every week to send to her?

657
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,907
Then we need to get a tape recorder

658
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:50,874
and cassettes.

659
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,910
Because you can't use a computer in there.

660
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,778
I think I have a tape recorder.

661
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,346
My dad left it behind.

662
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:58,515
That would work.

663
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,251
Then what should we talk about in our first episode?

664
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,556
What about "The Name of the Rose"?
