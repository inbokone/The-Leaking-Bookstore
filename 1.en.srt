But do you know?

334
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,799
This is actually a common spice.

335
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,121
There were cases before
where people got poisoned

336
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:37,969
because they didn't
properly peel the nutmeg.

337
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,905
Also, You can't prove that

338
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,339
he ate it the day he died.

339
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,643
Maybe he just ate it by accident the first time.
But he got lucky and didn't eat much.

340
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,080
However, the second time he ate it,
he ran out of luck.

341
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,449
No, the point is we don't even know
if there's poison in this bag.

342
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,651
Why am I discussing it with you?

343
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,386
Just test it.

I have a hunch

345
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,124
that Sole cinnamon roll

346
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,725
was put there on purpose.

Lin Mu Chin.

348
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,732
Did the DA approve the test?

349
00:26:07,017 --> 00:26:09,134
This could be key evidence.

350

353
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,378
You are too self-centered and stubborn.

Don't make personal attacks.

355

I'll handle the DA.

Just test what's inside.

Let me know the result when it comes out!

So the marketing manager
from the publishing house

00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,010
told me to interact more with the fans.

Just because he wrote this,

413
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,541
doesn't mean in ten hours

414
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:10,215
anyone would come up with an answer.

was Lin Chun Guei.

Six months before the incident,

Guei was released from jail on probation.

475

when he came here?

Yes.

487
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,950
I don't have many clients with long hair,

488

so I remember him.

489
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:36,321
I think the hair is down to here,
to his shoulders.

490
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,789
You think it's the same guy

491
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,490
because of the face, too.

492

Yeah.

there were three witnesses now.

00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,339
And just like that,
the police decided Chun Guei Lin

was the guy they were looking for.

00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:05,350
Yes. How can there be three witnesses

502
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,453
and yet it's still not direct evidence.

503
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,521
If two people identify at the same time,

504
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,190
they will influence each other.

505
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,658
And you see,

506
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,561
these pictures are not really impartial.

507
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,479
As for this picture of Lin Chun Guei,

508
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,965
the police took it for him in the questioning room.

509
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,735
You can see he's in a prison uniform.

510
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,704
As for the other suspects,

511
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,372
they all have normal headshots.

512
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:31,109
Also, their hair is shorter.

513
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,177
The hair length alone,

514
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,579
would make it easy for people

515
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,116
to identify this picture.

516
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,916
In psychology,

517
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,435
we call it

518
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,754
"Weapon focus effect".

519
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,122
Simply put,

520
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,590
if a suspect

521
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,859
is holding a dangerous weapon.

522
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,160
The witness on the scene

523
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,269
will go through tremendous stress,

524
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:54,499
so they can't correctly remember the suspect's face.

525
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,202
So even though the first two
witnesses were at the scene,

526
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,505
there's a great possibility

527
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,607
that they didn't remember his face at all.

528
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,738
The third witness' testimony

529
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:06,310
is also not admissible.

530
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,379
Because she wasn't at the scene.

531
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,185
She based only on the portrait

532
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:14,188
to identify someone she knew.

533
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,395
Looks like even God does not approve.

534
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,798

544
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:54,992
Dad?

545
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,561
Chin.

546
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,063
Nothing important.
Just want to ask you about

547
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,264
the cartons in your room.

548
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,266
Do you want me to send them to you?

549
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:04,469
No need,

550
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,440
I've taken care of them.

551
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,463
Oh really.

552
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,314
Don't exhaust yourself.

553
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,846
Auntie Chi Hui said you're stretching yourself thin.

554
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,914
Even digging in garbage dumps.

555
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,282
What happened?

556
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,799
Tell me.

557
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:21,185
It's nothing.

558
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,186
Dad, I'm busy.

559
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,422
I'll call you tomorrow.
Bye.

560
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,391
Okay.

561
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:32,964
- Need help?
- No.

562
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,773
It's pouring outside. When you
drive back, tell Wen to be careful.

563
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:36,834
I will...

564
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,303
Wei, It's leaking from the inside too.

565
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,872
- Again?
- The ceiling.

566
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,397
Get me a rag from inside to absorb the water.

567
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:45,610
- And a mop!
- Rag.

568
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,150
- Goose, go grab a bucket for me.
- Okay.

569
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,919
My car is here, hurry!

570
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:59,357
- Wei.
- This rain is ridiculous.

571
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,892
Will it flood in here?

572
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,794
- What?
- What happened?

573
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,800
Sorry. I dropped your violin.

574
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,271
Pass me the bucket.

575
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,241
It's not broken, is it?

576
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:19,589
Let me do it.

577
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:24,379
I don't think so.

578
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:25,848
It's fine. I'll just put it back.

579
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,187
The rain is really big.

580
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,454
Be careful when you drive.

581
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,656
Okay.

582
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,723
Got everything?

583
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,158
Yes.

584
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,594
- Did you bring an umbrella?
- Yes.

585
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,863
Wei, you're staying?

586
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,933
I want to work on the novel.

587
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:45,303
Still haven't figure out what surprise
that Ghost guy's pulling in 8 hours.

588
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,637
You are the president of our Mystery club.

589
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,306
It's gonna be fine.

590
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,674
- Bye, Wei.
- Bye.

591
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,475
- Be careful.
- Okay.

592
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:17,868
Gosh!

593
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,136
Careful. Take it slow.

594
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,074
- Bye!
- Bye!

595
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:32,350
[Why don't you reply?
Don't you want money?]

596
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:39,754
Oh shoot!

597
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,475
- You get off from this side.
- Okay.

598
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,516
Careful.

599
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,278
Let's go

600
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,919
[Hair Salon]

601
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,388
The rain is ridiculous.

602
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,596
I was thinking...

603
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,198
Are we really not telling Wei?

604
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,333
Tell him what?

605
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,102
That you are wet?

606
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,038
Nonsense!

607
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,873
I'm being serious.

608
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,309
What?
I told you, he won't listen now.

609
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,543
We talked about it.

610
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,378
What if he finds out?

611
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,846
It's gonna be awkward.

612
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,548
Finds out...

613
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:38,708
You're wet?

614
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,051
Asshole!

615
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,489
My mom's sleeping.

616
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,855
- It's your fault!
- I'm gonna take a shower now.

617
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,490
You're the wettest of them all!

618
00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:24,829
Chung Yun Wen.

619
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:25,896
Here.

620
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,431
Thanks.

621
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:28,833
Wait wait wait.

622
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,167
Help me with my wig.

623
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,569
You take the front side.

624
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:08,839
Chin.

625
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,609
It's raining, you don't want to go home?

626
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,144
I'll be leaving soon.

627
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,512
Okay, I'm gonna go now.

628
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,580
- Bye!
- Stay safe.

629
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,886
We've all taken a cab before, right?

630
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,255
Its bright yellow body is pretty eye-catching.

631
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,123
Does anyone know why?

632
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,164
By the way...

633
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,800
Have you seen "The Big Yellow Cab"?

634
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,435
Yes I did.

635
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,903
It's pretty solid.

636
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:16,373
Don't worry, you'll win the million bucks.

637
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,577
See, there are no new comments.

638
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,845
It's gonna be fine.

639
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,914
Nowadays people are all talk. No action.

640
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,751
Damn.

641
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,725
Hey!

642
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:11,794
Hey!

643
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,834
Stop!

644
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,919
Hey! Hey!

645
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,734
You saw fire, and then?

646
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:54,305
Then I got off the car.

647
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:57,008
The fire was pretty big,
and I saw someone in the car.

648
00:42:57,008 --> 00:43:00,678
So I wanted to call him.
But he didn't respond.

649
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,114
So I thought I could find
something to stop the fire.

650
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,416
I went back there.

651
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,897
I found a sack

652
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:09,753
and I dip it in water to put out the fire.

653
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,122
Did I contaminate the crime scene?

654
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,925
Yes, but it's fine.

655
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,595
You just said you saw
someone suspicious

656
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,696
- leaving on a scooter?
- Yes.

657
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:21,865
After you put out the fire?

658
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,568
Hey!

659
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,036
Yes.

660
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,871
Did you notice anything about him?

661
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,942
He was fast, he went that way.

662
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,043
And then...

663
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:37,247
Because it's dark here
I didn't see his license plate.

664
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:39,817
Okay.

665
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,787
So this is your usual route?

666
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:47,057
Yes, I usually take this route home.

667
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,526
We'll need your fingerprints later

668
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,717
- to rule you out as a suspect.
- Okay.

669
00:43:51,717 --> 00:43:53,185
- Okay?
- Yeah.

670
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,035
Is that your car?

671
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,970
Yes

672
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,272
Can we take a look?

673
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,811
Why?

674
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,279
Am I a suspect?

675
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,816
Just a routine check, don't be nervous.

677
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,019
Are you done?

678
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,759
The trunk too.

679
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:56,860
Please.

680
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:58,862
The trunk.

681
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,268
Hey junior!

682
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,874
Come help me.

683
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:07,942
Coming!

[Preview]
Let's talk about...

685
00:45:34,302 --> 00:45:38,117
A very regular theme
in mystery novels.

686
00:45:38,117 --> 00:45:39,206
Betrayal.

687
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:41,905
If someone was collecting debt,

688
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,940
they wouldn't chop his thumb

689
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,341
then kill him right away.

690
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,277
Again?

691
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,413
I told you there's nothing suspicious.

692
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,782
Am I being questioned?

693
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,617
Do you need to be questioned?

694
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:55,247
Mister.

695
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,922
The bookmark from ten years ago.

696
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,057
Who did it?

697
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,191
Who put it there?
