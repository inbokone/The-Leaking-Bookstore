When I was going to help you

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,478
retrieve your phone,

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,747
I already thought of a way.

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,117
There are so many things in your phone.

5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,053
What if other people see them?

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,855
Did you see them?

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,590
It was unavoidable.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,125
Otherwise, how would I know that the phone belongs to you?

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,666
Let go!

10
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,673
Gi?

11
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,574
Gi Chun Ting.

12
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,609

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,512
I will teach you now.

So?

15

Want to kill me right?

16
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,448
Go and die!

17
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,688
No!

18

Come and kill me!

19

Get up!

20
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,231
No.

21

Get up!

22
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,103
No.

23
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,806
No.

24
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,589
Yun Wen, is that you?

25
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,694
Yun Wen.

What will you say?

30
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,961
I will say the truth.

00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,296
Otherwise what can I say?

32
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,000
You can say we did it together.

33
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,610
You did it...don't drag me down.

34
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,880
You were a bystander...you are responsible too.

35
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,824
You forced me to!

36
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,127
You saw it too.

37
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,996
I didn't want to kill her at first either.

38
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,731
It was an accident.

39

I just got out of jail...you need to help me!

40

42
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,607
I got hurt and snatched the knife from her.

43
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,075
Then you came to help.

44

He will definitely drag us down and cause us to fail.

Do you think attending this class is useful?

101
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,807
Teacher, actually I want to ask

102
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,909
Why did Kuo Chun Yi pass?

103
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,911
Even someone like him could pass.

104
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,613
How come Ah Yao couldn't?

105
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,381
Because Kuo Chun Yi is young,

106
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,850
so he stands a better chance?

107
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,650
Okay, it's because

108
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,953
I taught him for three classes.

109
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,822
I monitored him and recorded my findings for  a year and a half.

110
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,757
I really saw him change.

111
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,926
- Hence in the evaluation report I--
- Teacher.

112
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:14,794
You have absolutely no idea

113
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,330
what Kuo Chun Yi did in the dormitory and factory.

114
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,598
If you did,

115
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,000
You would have known that he didn't really repent.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,636
Teacher, you only saw the surface.

117
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,937
That isn't accurate at all.

118
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,672
So the evaluation committee just reads some reports

119
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,508
to decide.

120
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,209
Then I feel that it's really unfair.

121
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,978
They don't know us at all

122
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,013
but they get to decide whether we pass.

123
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,581
I really hope that you guys won't

124
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,782
view group therapy this way.

125
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,584
No, teacher.

126
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,152
The Old Bird spoke correctly.

127
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,787
Group therapy, psychotherapy...

128
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,823
It's about who's the better actor.

129
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,691
So those who pass the evaluation

130
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,560
are Oscar winners.

131
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,995
Yes, he can win an Oscar.be an Oscar winner.

132
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,563
I can become an Oscar winner too.

133
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,564
Nice.

134
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,566
Oscar winner.

135
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,234
The prison will definitely hold a meeting to review the incident.

136
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,836
Maybe they will even hold you accountable.

137
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,005
You should prepare a report.

138
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,573
In the last evaluation,

139
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,975
you put in a lot of good words for him.

140
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,943
If the matter is serious,

141
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,244
I'm afraid your employment contract

142
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,712
will be affected.

143
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,784
Chi Hon pled guilty.

144
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,386
What he told the judge and the DA (District Attorney)

145
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,820
is exactly the same as what he said at the police station.

146
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,289
He admitted to the crime.

147
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,926
That's impossible.

148
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,627
He didn't know that person at all.

149
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,696
Why would he kill her?

150
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,597
He insisted that

151
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,232
when he was threatening the victim for money,

152
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,800
he stabbed her once or twice.

153
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,069
Then Kuo Chun Yi had a moment of psychosis.

154
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,737
He couldn't remember how many more times he stabbed her.

155
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,072
Lies.

156
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,241
Kuo Yi Chun doesn't have any mental illness.

157
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,410
He made it all up.

158
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,579
He must have my brother to take the blame.

159
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,547
I asked Chi Hon.

160
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,416
He insisted he wasn't threatened or induced into saying that.

161
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,284
That was the truth.

162
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,689
Miss Chang, I think

163
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,657
You should hurry and get some money ready.

164
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,960
The bail is NT$350,000.

165
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,829
NT$350,000?

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,136
There's a 10% tax on the prize money.

167
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,639
Did you bring your ID? Let me have a look.

168
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,344
Okay, thanks.

169
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,746
Later, help me sign here and here.

170
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,880
I will go and photocopy this.

171
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,420

fell on your violin.

that you couldn't help me get my phone back.

Did you owe him money?

368
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,436
You wouldn't dare to owe him money.

I heard you're not taking the bar exam.

It's a huge waste of your law degree.

I know being a judge or a DA is difficult.

413
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,396
But being a lawyer would be good too.

414
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,499
It's not bad.

415

Yes, I've been considering it.

No, no.

418
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,974
You should take the exam when you're young.

If you don't take the exam now,

00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,466
This piece of evidence is too weak.

512
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,034
Can you think of

513
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,169
for them to set you up?

514
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,044
You see,

515
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,879
they used something to block this drain.

516
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,980
So the rainwater couldn't flow out.

517
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,482
Then the water flowed here and leaked out.

518
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,953
I wanted to stay behind to finish my draft that day.

519
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,020
If the water leak hadn't dripped onto my laptop,

520
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,622
I wouldn't have gone home.

521
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,527
Did anyone disappear in the middle of your gathering?

522
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,031
I thought about this many times.

523
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,733
I only remember that people took toilet breaks

524
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,601
of maximum five minutes.

525
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,369
But for people who are familiar with this place,

526
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,471
five minutes is enough for them to do these things.

527
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,111
Okay then let me tell you one more thing.

528
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:02,914
In the taxi,

529
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,949
there was originally a copy of "The Decagon House Murders".

530
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,050
I took it away and

531
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,186
put it in my safe.

532
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,754
I can give it to you so that you can check for fingerprints.

533
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,156
Take it.

534
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,066
I'll tell you the result.

535
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,354
Doctor Chung, the patient is here.

536
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,522
Okay thank you.

537
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:47,725
Mr Ku.

538
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,727
Hello doctor.

539
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,702
Trauma in my childhood?

540
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,078
At the time, my parents were considered as

541
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,614
highly qualified intellectuals.

542
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,651
Honestly, I've never suffered

543
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,820
any form of abuse.

544
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,555
No.

545
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:23,027
Then, who are your parents to you?

546
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:31,202
I had a stomachache once in junior high school.

547
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,371
My dad

548
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,640
didn't care at all.

549
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,242
My mom

550
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,647
thought that I was faking it

551
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,582
to avoid going to school.

552
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,584
So they didn't bother about it.

553
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,622
After that, I had a high fever at the student clinic.

554
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,925
They hurriedly sent me to the hospital for emergency treatment.

555
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,963
I remember when I was in the hospital,

556
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,304
I felt helpless and kept crying loudly.

557
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,540
Every time I needed their help,

558
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:12,877
they weren't there.

559
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,849
Time to eat.

560
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,651
Oyster, go bring the bowls quickly.

561
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,454
Hurry up.

562
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,026
Newbie, time to eat.

563
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,363
Stomachache.

564
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,233
Stomachache? If you have a stomachache, go take a dump.

565
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,304
[Female Victim Sent To The Hospital For Emergency Treatment]

566
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:48,513
Store manager.

567
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,381
Liu? Why are you here? Do you have a shift today?

568
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,682
I'm covering for Lan.

569
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,986
I'm in a hurry.

570
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,120
Okay.

571
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,624
You ask about people's childhoods all the time.

572
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,560
Do you remember your own?

573
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,630
Have you thought of something?

574
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,966
It's my turn to ask you.

575
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,305
When did you first masturbate?

576
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,714
So? Were there any fingerprints in the end?

577
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,783
No...I checked over and over again.

578
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,418
There should be none.

579
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,754
No fingerprints.

580
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,525
This is already your third book.

581
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,128
Why? If you get the full set can you exchange it for a gift?

582
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,997
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

583
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,900
Wait.

584
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,369
I still have a quick question.

585
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,005
What quick question now?

586
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:52,143
When I was in sixth grade.

587
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,712
One day I was in my room.

588
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,048
I started masturbating alone.

589
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,353
Suddenly my mom came in.

590
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:12,029
My mom caught me masturbating.

591
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:17,001
My mom froze...I froze too.

592
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,272
I didn't even have time to wear my pants

593
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,442
before my mom slapped me.

594
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,545
When my mom helped me put on my pants again,

595
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,546
I...

596
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,216
I was very...

597
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,319
ashamed of myself.

598
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:37,955
I'm investigating a case

599
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,658
where a metal wire was used to cut off someone's windpipe.

600
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,394
It's possible if they used violin strings.

601
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,729
Just check whether the victim's wound

602
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,464
has any residue and you'll know.

603
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,733
Is there a way to tell which string was used?

604
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,204
It's difficult to deduce it solely from the wound.

605
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,138
I need to be able to zoom into the violin string and see

606
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:54,939
whether there was

607
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,874
any indentation left on it.

608
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,309
I don't know about violins.

609
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,211
But I know that metal strings are sharp.

610
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,412
If you stretch it suddenly,

611
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,847
you will definitely cut your hands.

612
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:06,284
So you must wear gloves...and the string can't be too thin.

613
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,755
So I would choose this one, the thickest one.

614
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,191
G string.

615
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,626
The area to apply pressure is big enough.

616
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,895
It can kill yet at the same time it wouldn't easily cut your hands.

617
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,830
G string should be the most suitable.

618
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,340
When I grew up and remembered this incident,

619
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,210
I felt...

620
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,713
I thought that it's quite funny.

621
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,987
Have you heard of anyone

622
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:47,224
getting caught masturbating by their moms?

623
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:57,435
Were you caught by your mom?

624
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,680
Open your mouth.

625
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,052
Doctor, hurry. Doctor.

626
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,354
Give me a moment.

627
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,388
What happened?

628
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,558
What happened?

629
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,225
Let me take a look.

630
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,326
Chang Chi Hon.

631
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,629
How are you feeling?

632
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,999
Stomachache.

633
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,702
Why are you here?

634
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,437
Thinking of a way.

635
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,276
You will tell me about him, right?

636
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,711
What?

637
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,947
What's his name?

638
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,984
You wouldn't know even if I tell you.

639
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,819
Excuse me.

640
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,487
I want to ask about

641
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,122
Chang Ai Chi, who was stabbed a few days ago.

642
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,223
Was she sent here?

643
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,324
You are?

644
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,859
I'm her cousin.

645
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,727
Please wait and let me check.

646
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,996
Why was he in jail?

647
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,632
Sexual assault.

648
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:04,335
A pervert who likes to abuse minors.

649
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,303
How did you know that one of them was my sister?

650
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,806
Why do you have so many questions today?

651
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,875
He mentioned Ming Ren University.

652
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,943
Isn't that your sister's school?

653
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,347
The condition of Chang Ai Chi on bed number five is unstable.

654
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,982
He needs an emergency operation.

655
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:19,984
Hurry.

656
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:21,819
Have you informed the doctor?

657
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,120
What's the current status?

658
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,156
The patient has hypotension and is barely conscious.

659
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,757
Is the patient in shock? Tell me her medical history.

660
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,159
Due to her knife injury, the patient has lost an excessive amount of blood.

661
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,727
Send her to the operation room for emergency treatment.

662
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,609
Hello, Lan.

663
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,811
I went to collect the prize.

664
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,013
But they said that we can only take it next month.

665
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,387
You said that girl died?

666
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,556
Oh my god, what should we do now?

667
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,258
Do you want to ask Chen Wei

668
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,793
whether he has any ideas?

669
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,397
He didn't take your call.

670
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,867
That...that ADA?

671
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:13,737
Okay the lawyer is there.

672
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,272
Okay go do what you need to do.

673
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,408
Okay bye.

674
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,718
Hello, I'm Gi Chun Ting.

675
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,254
Chen Shou is looking for me.

676
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,490
Okay, let me see your ID.

677
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,958
Okay.

678
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,359
How do you come to know Kuo Yi Chun?

679
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,029
I...

680
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:17,701
already knew him previously

681
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,939
due to work.

682
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,607
But we were not close.

683
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,809
I only saw him a few times.

684
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,482
Do you know he killed someone?

685
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,775
You're back.

686
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,110
Why are you here?

687
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,916
You weren't home when I came by in the late afternoon.

688
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:09,053
So I let myself in.

689
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,654
Sorry.

690
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,724
These things....curtains--

691
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:17,227
The curtains...coincidentally I saw this colour

692
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,596
and thought that it suited this place.

693
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,397
So I bought and changed the curtains.

694
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,365
I changed the curtains upstairs too.

695
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,000
I'll show you. Come.

696
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,903
Come up and see.

697
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,244
See.

698
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,014
This is very comfortable.

699
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,050
The curtains here

700
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,386
are the same as the ones downstairs too.

701
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:43,887
Very cute, right?

702
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,529
Do you like them?

703
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,210
What's wrong?

704
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,813
What's wrong? You don't like them?

705
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,692
Who do you think you are?

706
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,161
Don't you know that you only survive by relying on women?

707
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,797
I just thought that I could--

708
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,301
What's wrong?

709
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,771
You are just a truck driver, okay?

710
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,072
Are you worthy of her?

711
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,107
Can you support her?

712
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,843
I'm here, don't worry.

713
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,978
Okay.

714
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,482
Okay, it's fine.

715
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,394
[From Chung Yun Wen: Chen Wei read our piece "To Be Loved", the situation is very serious.]

716
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,730
[From Chung Yun Wen: Are you back yet? Hurry up!]

717
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,198
Goose!

718
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,668
I came here today to warn you

719
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,369
that Gi Chun Ting is not a good person.

720
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,638
If you get closer to him,

721
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,441
you will die a miserable death.

722
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,976
I have really changed.

723
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,445
Please don't cause trouble for me again in the future.

724
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,681
I found a suspicious address.

725
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,049
He used Chen Xi Secondhand Bookstore's

726
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,851
name to order the books.

727
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,819
The livestream will be temporarily closed and updated.

728
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,622
The Mystery Bookstore will close temporarily too.
