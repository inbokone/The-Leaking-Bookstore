00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,920
Have you read The Big Yellow Cab?

173
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,588
Yes I did,

174
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,290
there are no issues with it.

175
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:28,394
Don't worry, you'll win the million dollars.

176
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,499
Lin Chun Guei's case has been ten years,

177
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:36,769
but the investigation was murky.

178
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,137
Especially...

179
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:41,207
his hair.

180
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:45,244
- Bye, Wei.
- Bye!

181
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:46,260
Be careful.

182
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:50,916
May I know what's the reason?

183
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,485
We're not clear either,

184
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,572
but we got calls from the DA's office.

185
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,189
They wanted Chen Shen Ho's medical records.

186
00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:00,593
And we discovered that you have
downloaded some of his data.

187
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:10,903
You need passwords?

188
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:13,172
Of course.

189
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:16,542
All the patients' personal data are in there.

190
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,378
My reports are in there too.

191
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:33,125
[Where did you go after the bookstore last night?]

192
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:49,842
What are you drawing?

193
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:51,577
You can't tell?

194
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:53,393
What's this?

195
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,314
It's me.

196
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:56,682
What about this?

197
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:58,851
It's my hand.

198
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:01,821
Why are your body and hand apart?

199
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,555
Because sometimes I feel like

200
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:07,426
my hands are not mine.

201
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:11,063
When do you feel this way?

202
00:15:11,063 --> 00:15:12,932
Often.

203
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:14,800
If I put it out like this,

204
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,602
I don't feel that they're apart.

205
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:18,804
But when I take a shower,

206
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:21,340
it feels like someone else's hand.

207
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,414
When you take a shower,

208
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,348
it feels like someone's touching you?

209
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:38,724
Teacher, can you take me to the toilet?

210
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:40,359
Sure, let's go.

211
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:47,600
Let me know when you're done.

212
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,268
- I'll wait for you here.
- Okay

213
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:51,637
Next time, be careful.
Come back again on Wednesday.

214
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:54,907
Chang Chi Hon.

215
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:55,908
Your class is over?

216
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:59,712
Pretty teacher,
what do you want this time?

217
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:01,447
Go home soon.

218
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,182
Why are you off so early today?

219
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:04,917
Your sister just texted me.

220
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:07,019
What did she say?

221
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,754
Nothing much.

222
00:16:09,597 --> 00:16:11,023
How are things?

223
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:13,392
How's class?

224
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:14,460
Nothing much.

225
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:16,510
Be good,

226
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,430
don't let your sister worry.

227
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,565
Okay.

228
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,834
I've got stuff to do, Goose.

229
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,236
- I've got to go.
- Okay, bye.

230
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:27,172
Let's move.

231
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:28,407
Took you long enough.

232
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:29,575
Where are you going?

233
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:31,577
Don't know... How about to the movies?

234
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:32,878
Wanna go together?

235
00:16:32,878 --> 00:16:34,346
No.

236
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,784
I'm done.

237
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:40,334
You're done?

238
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,388
Pei Han.

239
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,522
Can you take care of Ning for me?

240
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:45,057
I need to take care of something.

241
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:46,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

242
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,088
Excuse me, miss.

243
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,429
I just want to take a look at

244
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,231
where she's getting counseling.

245
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:54,400
I also bought doughnuts.

246
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,502
- It's Ning's favorite.
- No.

247
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:58,404
Ning's mom has a restraining order.

248
00:16:58,404 --> 00:17:00,072
You can't contact the victim.

249
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,075
So...

250
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,346
Can you pass these to her instead?

251
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:08,514
It's very famous,

252
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:11,183
- I queued for a long time-
- Mr. Gi.

253
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:12,251
Do you think this

254
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:15,254
can make up for what you did?

255
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:18,190
Do you know I can report you?

256
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,358
See if the judge

257
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:21,627
would revoke your probation.

258
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:28,200
Yes.

259
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,004
I know you can report me.

260
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:35,074
But can you please

261
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:36,375
listen to Ning's side of the story?

262
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,277
Or my side of the story?

263
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:40,980
Don't just believe what her mom said.

264
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,749
Do you know her mom is sick?

265
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:44,817
I pleaded guilty

266
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,118
to protect Ning.

267
00:17:46,118 --> 00:17:48,287
So that she could be free
from her mom's control.

268
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,906
- Why are you...
- What are you talking about?

269
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:52,958
Ning's mom, I thought you...

270
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,660
What did you tell Gi?

271
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,228
Wen, don't be like this. Wen.

272
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:57,663
You are such a horndog.

273
00:17:57,663 --> 00:18:00,299
Why are you so shameless!
Why are you so shameless!

274
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,834
What did you tell me?

275
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:04,136
What did you tell me?

276
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:05,371
Shameless!

277
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:07,306
It's fine.

278
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,307
It's fine.

279
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:11,410
Wen, I'm here to see you.

280
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,313
I'm here for you, did you forget?

281
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,883
What did you tell me?

282
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:20,619
I'm here now.

283
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,055
It's fine now.

284
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:24,690
Don't cry.

285
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:37,269
Sis.

286
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:41,073
I'll text you back later.

287
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,642
Why are you here?

288
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:46,178
Shouldn't you be with
Goose at this time of the day?

289
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:47,279
It ended.

290
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,986
I'm here for the inhaler.

291
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,087
You're out again?

292
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,823
So fast?

293
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:00,659
The air quality has been bad recently.

294
00:19:02,294 --> 00:19:05,531
Haven't I told you not
to use it too often?

295
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:07,433
Twice a day at most.

296
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,101
You never listen.

297
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:12,671
If you use too often, you'll get dependent.

298
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:16,108
I know.

299
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:31,223
Sis.

300
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:34,226
My friend needs medicine for his stuffy nose.

301
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:35,928
Do you have the strongest one?

302
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:38,262
We have it.
It's the one in front of you.

303
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:45,037
How many boxes can I take?

304
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:46,572
Two boxes at most.

305
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,874
I'll go and get your inhaler.

306

[The Million Dollar Mystery
Novel Contest Nomination Dinner]

307
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,871
The police and the media

308
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:21,106
were pointing finger at her husband.

309
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:22,908
Do you know what happened?

310
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:24,076
They discovered that

311
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:27,546
she was staying at a hot spring resort.

312
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:28,961
She was having the time of her life

313
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,117
watching the whole
country judging her husband.

314
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:33,752
She's really good then.

315
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,120
Yes.

316
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,555
You're here.

317
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:38,490
I'll introduce you.

318
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,758
This is Chen Wei.

319
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:41,827
He is the author of "The Big Yellow Cab".

320
00:20:41,827 --> 00:20:43,362
He also owns a bookstore.

321
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,830
It's called The Deduction Bookstore.

322
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,198
"The Big Yellow Cab".

323
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:48,567
Isn't that the novel that
went up to no.2 yesterday?

324
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,002
You're favored to win!

325
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:53,672
And you are?

326
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:57,209
Nice to meet you,
I'm the author of "Knock on Wood".

327
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:02,214
I wrote "Reason for My Smile".

328
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:06,944
Who wrote "Beloved"?

329
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:08,287
"Beloved"...

330
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:09,855
You came for the top author...

331
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:11,590
They didn't come.

332
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:13,692
"They"?

333
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:15,794
Yeah, I heard they wrote it as a group.

334
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:17,863
I haven't met them though.
Have you met them?

335
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:20,866
Quite mysterious.

336
00:21:53,165 --> 00:21:56,183
What kind of letter did the
planning department received?

337
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,018
You mean "the Ghost" from the forum?

338
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:00,472
I didn't see the letter.

339
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:03,175
But the editor has asked everyone

340

The case is still unsolved until now.

The DA thought that it
was a sudden cardiac death,

If it's not done by someone they know,

then it's probably a stranger.

00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:49,801
DA's office contacted me?

510
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,172
ADA? What did she want?

511
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:57,375
Okay, understood.

512
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,615
Wait, I have another call.

513
00:30:58,615 --> 00:30:59,811
Alright, thanks.

514
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:04,883
Hello, Chen Chin Peng.

515
00:31:04,883 --> 00:31:06,151
What's up?

516
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:10,021
Someone saw Chen Shen Ho at a gay bar?

517
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:11,890
When?

518
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,374
Yesterday? That's impo...

519
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,621
Nothing...

520
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,030
Okay, thanks.

521
00:31:29,107 --> 00:31:30,742
Buns.

522
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:32,210
All for me?

523
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,411
That's too much.

524
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:35,180
Take them to the bookstore.

525
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:37,782
Wait!

526
00:31:37,782 --> 00:31:39,184
Are you driving us later

527
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:41,486
or are we taking the taxi?

528
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:44,422
We've searched up

529
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:46,224
a few different forums.

530
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:47,859
There were no signs of "the Ghost".

531
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:50,595
I think... it might be a new account.

532
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:59,571
Why didn't Wen come?

533
00:31:59,571 --> 00:32:01,439
Doesn't he have a hacker friend?

534
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:03,074
Something came up.

535
00:32:03,074 --> 00:32:04,309
What thing?

536
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:07,712
None of your business.

537
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:09,447
Help me tell Wei that

538
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:11,249
something came up at the clinic,

539
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:13,184
or that I'm not well.

540
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:14,719
Or else he'll get mad again.

541
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:15,787
Okay.

542
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:19,799
He's not well today.

543
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,092
Then why did he only tell you,

544
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:22,727
and not tell us in the group chat?

545
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:37,976
I think...

546
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,880
Should we just ignore "the Ghost" for now?

547
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,715
Anyways, no one would
care about it after the contest,

548
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:44,749
right?

549
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,851
Easy for you to say.

550
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:48,553
You're not writing the novel.

551
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:50,153
You don't need a million dollars either.

552
00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:56,394
Thanks, Hua.

553
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:05,303
Someone asked

554
00:33:05,303 --> 00:33:07,839
Lin Chun Guei had long hair at the time.

555
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,690
Why didn't he just cut it?

556
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,026
Maybe then he wouldn't get caught.

557
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:14,579
Hmm... of course, we're not Chun Guei Lin.

558
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:16,147
We can't answer for him

559
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:19,417
But I have an explanation
for you to consider.

560
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:20,585
Remember

561
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:22,687
the police only caught him

562
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:24,789
five months after?

563
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:26,291
At the time,

564
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,293
he had probably let his guard down.

565
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:31,129
Wanted posters of him were
already out for a few months,

566
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:32,764
yet he still wasn't caught.

567
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:36,034
Moreover, he didn't cut his hair.

568
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:39,604
At that time,
the suspect would start to feel

569
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:41,339
that the police were idiots.

570
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,908
"I'm right here and yet
you still couldn't catch me".

571
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:45,457
This sense of superiority

572
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:49,781
would make him want to test the police's limits.

573
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:52,083
So, he didn't cut his hair.

574
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,887
How do we prove that he
had this kind of thoughts?

575
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,989
He once told his cell mates that

576
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:00,512
he's been in and out of jail too frequently.

577
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:02,418
He knew how to pass a polygraph.

578
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:03,944
Even if he did something again,

579
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:05,844
it's not easy to get caught.

580
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,566
Oh it was his cellmate that said it.

581
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:10,969
Everyone, be careful who your cellmates are.

582
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,837
That's it for today,

583
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:14,964
see you next week. Bye.

584
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:16,566
- Bye.
- Bye.

585
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:24,849
Hi.

586
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,655
Nice suit.

587
00:34:30,655 --> 00:34:31,823
Where did you buy it?

588
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:34,926
Thanks.

589
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:41,854
I specialize in treating bad moods.

590
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:45,770
I specialize in treating psychos.

591
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:53,778
You must have a lot to share.

592
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,049
I can share too.

593
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:59,117
Follow me.

594
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:05,308
Let me know when you change your mind.

595
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:21,806
- Chen Shen Ho.
- What?

596
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,075
Sorry, I recognised the wrong person.

597
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:32,016
Wei, bye.

598
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,551
Wait.

599
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:39,023
During the live stream just now,

600
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:41,092
you mentioned Lin Chun Guei.

601
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:42,827
Something came to me.

602
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:44,162
Both of you should hear it.

603
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,465
Other than the four of us,

604
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:50,301
who would care about the issue with the hair?

605
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:02,847
Hua, have you seen my phone?

606
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,048
No.

607
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:10,955
Nothing.

608
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:12,824
Go home now.

609
00:36:13,758 --> 00:36:15,843
You too, rest well.

610
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:16,843
Bye.

611
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:37,715
Shao.

612
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,352
I lost my phone, help me.
Quick! Quick! Quick!

613
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:42,353
The door. The door!

614
00:36:42,353 --> 00:36:43,621
My cat would get out.

615
00:37:05,476 --> 00:37:06,644
Gi?

616
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:10,815
It's really you.

617
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:12,884
Psychiatrist Chung.
What a coincidence.

618
00:37:12,884 --> 00:37:14,285
Long time no see.

619
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,162
How are things?

620
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:18,236
Haven't seen you in a while.
You have become so buff now.

621
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,707
- It feels like your jacket is going to burst soon.
- No...

622
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:21,738
I'm doing good recently.

623
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:23,394
Sir.

624
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:26,464
I work at a gym in the north area now.

625
00:37:26,464 --> 00:37:28,099
If you want to work out,

626
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:29,316
come find me.

627
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,935
I'll give you a discount.

628
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:32,170
I...

629
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:35,306
Maybe next time.

630
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:36,407
Okay.

631
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:37,558
Why are you here?

632
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:38,818
I'm looking for a friend.

633
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:40,144
Your friend lives here too?

634
00:37:40,144 --> 00:37:41,546
What a coincidence.

635
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:44,282
I'll go and find my friend now.

636
00:37:44,282 --> 00:37:45,416
Okay sure.

637
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,684
Bye, see you.

638
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:47,685
See you next time.

639
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:22,286
[You don't want your phone back?

off and you didn't answer the door when I knocked]

641
00:38:59,624 --> 00:39:01,459
Mr. Chung, someone's here for you.

642
00:39:02,293 --> 00:39:04,929
Hello I am ADA Lin Mu Chin.

643
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:07,298
Do you have time for some
questions about Chen Shen Ho?

644
00:39:26,784 --> 00:39:28,419
Miss Lin.

645
00:39:28,419 --> 00:39:30,054
What happened during therapy

646
00:39:30,054 --> 00:39:31,889
is confidential.

647
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:34,525
Especially when it involves other people.

648
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:36,894
Next time come with a witness summons,

649
00:39:36,894 --> 00:39:38,396
then I'll talk.

650
00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:39,964
- Please...
- I...

651
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:42,433
Just one more quick question.

652
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:46,070
Did he used to read mystery novels?

653
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,805
For example Sherlock Holmes.

654
00:39:49,974 --> 00:39:51,342
I don't know.

655
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:53,544
Why did you ask about this?

656
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:58,723
I found a novel from the Sherlock
Holmes series in his apartment.

657
00:39:58,723 --> 00:40:01,452
Quite unexpected for an ex-con.

658
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:03,921
But it could also be a
gift from someone, right?

659
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:06,324
Did he have classmates who would do that?

660
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,000
[The password you have

Damn it!

662
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:27,445
For tonight's Late Night Mysteryland,

663
00:40:30,381 --> 00:40:32,383
I was gonna talk about...

664
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:35,686
The Decagon House Murders.

665
00:40:37,221 --> 00:40:39,390
But I want to talk about something else today.

666
00:40:40,825 --> 00:40:42,760
Let's talk about

667
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,029
a regular theme

668
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:47,398

669
00:40:48,232 --> 00:40:49,500
Betrayal.

[Betrayal]

671
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,001
- Aunt Chi Hui.
- Yes?

672
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,099
I've finished writing the report.

673
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,757

674

DA Yang is still busy.

675

Auntie,

676
00:41:21,866 --> 00:41:23,634
these fruits are from my dad.

677
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:27,004
He said thank you for taking care of me.
We've troubled you.

678
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:29,006
That's not necessary.

679
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,008
I'll put them here.

680
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,278
The receipts that DA wanted you to check,

681
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:35,780
can you get it done in time?

682
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,249
Yes, I'm almost done.
So far so good.

683
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:39,249
Okay.

684
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:42,736
- Auntie.
- Yes?

685
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:45,089
What happened to the case that day?

686
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:47,841
The one that DA said he's
gonna investigate the loan sharks.

687
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,428
The unit said that...

688
00:41:50,428 --> 00:41:54,298
they couldn't find any leads to the loan sharks.

689
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:58,169
DA is re-strategizing now.

690
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,441
- Chi Hui, is the report ready?
- Yes

691
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:05,681
- Bring it to the conference room for me.
- Okay, coming.

692
00:42:08,112 --> 00:42:09,780
Go back and tell your dad,

693
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,582
no need to be so polite with me.

694
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:14,585
And you! Try to fit in faster.

695
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:16,654
Don't let your dad worry.

696
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:25,596
Mr. Kao, this way please.

697
00:42:28,332 --> 00:42:30,042
We need your fingerprints in these boxes.

698
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:31,569
The ink pad is here.

699
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:32,889
I'm gonna go and print something.

Are you done?

Which thumb do you need?

704
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:23,581
I saw flames.

705
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:26,250
And I was in the car,
too scared to act immediately.

706
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:31,330
When the fire got bigger, I ran to put it out.

707
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,737
Then...

708
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:36,360
I saw the driver wasn't responding.

An ADA came to find me.

711
00:45:34,918 --> 00:45:36,720
She said you witnessed a murder.

712
00:45:38,722 --> 00:45:39,957
Who are you?

713
00:45:39,957 --> 00:45:42,559
Granny, did you let him in?

714
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:44,828
He can't come to your house.

If you were just a witness,

716
00:45:47,297 --> 00:45:49,500
why was the police suspecting you?

717
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,535
Someone wanted to frame me.

718
00:45:51,535 --> 00:45:53,504
I'll find out who it is.

719
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:55,606
I found something interesting.

720
