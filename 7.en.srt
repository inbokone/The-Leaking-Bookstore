They entered the same writing competition as me

Yes.

220
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,941
We had at least six thousand cases in the past year.

221

This situation happened.

222

00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,477
whether we need to find a solution.

Yes, I turned in the report.

Okay, I'll go over now.

231
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,079
DA (District Attorney) Chu is waiting for you inside.

232
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,349
I was reading about the three cases

233
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,084
that DA Yang handed over.

234
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,620
I heard you're the person who is most familiar with these cases.

235
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,456
So I asked you to come here.

236
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,257
Do you have time to deal with this?

237
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,093
Yes, I'm not busy.

238
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,996
But DA Yang deemed these three cases

239
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,464
to be closed.

240
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,432
DA Yang was previously handling the Ding Hao case

241
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,568
and he had many matters to handle as well.

242
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:46,071
Plus he's not that interested in regular criminal cases.

243
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,173
I've read your reports.

244
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,843
You think that these three cases were done by a serial killer.

245
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,910
Right?

246
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,079
Yes

247
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,349
I agree with you.

248
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,018
Really?

249
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:00,853
In a short period of time,

250
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,754
in the same area,

251
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,989
several paroled sex offenders died in a row.

252
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,491
Plus just this year alone,

253
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,393
The death toll of ex-sex offenders

254
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,294
is five times more than the year before.

255
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,230
Even though the cause of death differs,

256
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,766
the number is still unusual.

257
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,101
You think that

258
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,405
someone is deliberately targeting sex offenders?

259
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,942
It's possible.

260
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,945
But who would do that?

261
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,114
I have a few suspects currently.

262
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,054
More accurately, I have two suspects.

263
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,622
They shared a senior-junior relationship

264
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,057
in a mystery club during college.

265
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,525
Presently, it looks like

266
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,160
the junior is more problematic.

267
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,263
Reporting to the DA,

268
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:44,897

269
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,432
interacted with them a little.

00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,542
We haphazardly wrote something

340
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,443
and ranked higher than him.

341
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,877
Of course he's upset.

342
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,181
How in the world did he find out?

343
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,183
Plus the competition has already ended.

344
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,717
I thought that everything would be fine.

345
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,355
Could it be that the publisher told him?

346
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,291
He's so close to the chief editor.

347
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,661
The publisher told him...

348
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:23,795
So if that's the case, the publisher

349
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,463
should also have told him

350
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,931
who "Ghost" is?

351
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,366
Otherwise the timing of the message is too coincidental.

352
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,170
Does "Ghost"'s message have anything to do with him?

353
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,909
It should be our senior who asked "Ghost" to leave that message.

354
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,845
Why?

355
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,813
To strike at those ranking ahead of him.

356
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,650
Our work won first prize

357
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,487
but was criticized for being logically flawed.

358
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,755
Would the publisher dare to publish it?

359
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,593
No way.

360
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,962
Senior can't be that bad.

361
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,396
Or...

362
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,235
Or "Ghost" is our senior?

363
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,770
Think about it.

364
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,205
In this whole situation,

365
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,507
he was fifth place from the start.

366
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,708
But the moment "Ghost" appeared,

367
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,710
he became second place.

368
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,311
Then at the end, he won third place.

369
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:13,945
So basically,

370
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,580
the "Ghost" helped him win a prize.

371
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,149
Plus the person who gained the most out of this entire situation

372
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,986
is our senior.

373
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,723
Wait, I don't think that's possible.

374
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:25,991
He even kept asking us to help find out

375
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,526
who "Ghost" is.

376
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:28,894
Or he already knew

377
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:29,995
we entered the competition too

378
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,364
[I can pick you up earlier today!]
and wanted to test us using this method.

379
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,368
Guys, I still have something to do.

380
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,869
I will hang up first.

381
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,238
Anyway guessing blindly is not a solution.

382
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,873
We will play it by ear.

383
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,008
Okay I'll hang up first, bye.
[Chung Yun Wen]

384
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,610
Wen Tsu Yen, when are you coming home?

385
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,892
Senior.

386
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,128
I don't know if it's appropriate for me to ask this.

387
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,764
Recently I've been busy with Chi Hon's matters.

388
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,367
Later I found out

389
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,201
that Kuo Yi Chun

390
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,571
was one of your cases when you were doing prison counselling.

391
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,312
Yes, he was.

392
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:27,786
Lan.

393
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,923
I'm very sorry for what happened to your brother.

394
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:39,598
Kuo Chun Yi got parole previously

395
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,499
on my recommendation.

396
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,705
He is

397
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,975
a kid whom nobody cared for since young.

398
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,146
He had a lot of caregivers.

399
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,183
Later he finally ended up with his father.

400
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,051
Unfortunately,

401
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,320
I knew that man as well.

402
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,357
He was an utterly rotten person.

403
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,894
During therapy, I often heard him talk about

404
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:15,166
how since young, he was strictly and

405
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,803
he was

406
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,838
So I thought...

407
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,840
Chun Yi.

408
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,909
Should I give him a chance

409
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,346
to stand straight and tall

410
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,281
and catch his breath.

411
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,771
Miss Chang, the investigative hearing is about to start.

412
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,305
Please wait outside for a while.

413
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,376
DA, I told you just now.

414
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,246
Both of us were the ones who did it, I wasn't the only one.

415
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,681
You are lying!

416
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,115
He alone did it.

417
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,017
He was the one who wanted me to share the blame.

418
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,154
Chang Chi Hon.

419
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,956
In your previous statement you admitted that

420
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,391
you two committed the crime.

421
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:17,162
Are you sure you want to change your testimony now?

422
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,129
This will affect

423
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,165
your credibility before the judge.

424
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,068
I said I would help him share the blame

425
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,537
in exchange for something.

426
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,338
You can ask him yourself.

427
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,807
Okay, now I know that

428
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,608
your promise was a lie.

429
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,277
My sister was right.

430
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,278
You are a rotten person.

431
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,815
Chang Chi Hon, calm down.

432
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,717
In Chang Chi Hon's statement that night,

433
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,719
he mentioned he called the police.

434
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,353
The police didn't check.

435
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,189
I've found his phone records.

436
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,356
Please take a look.

437
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,428
Sit down.

438
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,269
Do you still have any water?

439
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,538
I'm thirsty, give me water.

440
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:01,740
Hurry up.

441
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,021
I've found some crucial screenshots.

442
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,326
The taxi, on the night of the murder,

443
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,728
about an hour after their gathering ended,

444
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,131
drove out of a private parking lot.

445
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,600
Too bad the the surveillance camera didn't capture the driver.

446
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,035
The distance between this parking lot and the bookstore

447
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,937
is only seven hundred and fifty metres.

448
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,673
From the time of death, we can deduce that

449
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,742
the victim was already dead by then.

450
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:41,146
The driver was either the culprit or an accomplice.

451
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,350
The body may already have been in the car at that time.

452
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,585
Did all four of them have alibis?

453
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,791
Kao Chen Wei was in the bookstore.

454
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,126
After Chung Yun Wen sent Chung Ting Lan home,

455
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,528
he went home with Wen Tsu Yen.

456
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,996
Both of them are roommates.

457
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,164
Chang Ting Lan's younger brother said

458
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,533
They were watching a television series at home that night.

459
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,434
There are records of it being played.

460
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,544
But all three lived near the bookstore.

461
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,712
If the alibis were fake,

462
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,447
anyone of them could come out again to drive the car

463
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,650
after going home.

464
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,651
ADA (Assistant District Attorney).

465
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,151
Yes.

466
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,654
I've found the footage that you want.

467
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,721
Please play it.

468
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,390
The part you want

469
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,826
is around the seventeenth minute and thirtieth second.

470
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,728
This is footage of Chen Chin Peng, the third victim,

471
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,630
travelling to the beach.

472
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,398
The camera captured

473
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,166
an electric scooter following him from behind.

474
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,538
Very skinny.

475
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,106
Because we were tracking down his vehicle,

476
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,741
he sent the electric scooter for a vehicle inspection that day.

477
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,477
Coincidentally the surveillance cameras in the Department of Motor Vehicles caught it.

478
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:50,215
Something happened after the vehicle inspection.

479
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,317
The build is very different.

480
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,699
Isn't this Gi Chun Ting?

481
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,567
I've checked.

482
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:13,771
Gi Chun Ting has a different scooter model.

483
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,633
You wanted to make money.

484
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,600
Through an anonymous software,

485
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,003
you introduced them to the sex trade.

486
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,371
I need to know

487
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,005
what that anonymous software is.

488
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,819
I will get off work first.

489
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,821
Bye.

490
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,123
Hello, what are you doing?

491
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,558
Hello, have you ended work?

492
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,827
Wait, could you accompany me somewhere?

493
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,629
Not yet, I still have something to do.

494
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,399
I'll hit you up when I get home.

495
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,001
Okay.

496
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,369
Bye.

497
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,104
You dressed beautifully today.

498
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,573
Thanks...bye.

499
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,215
Goose!

500
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,670
Wen Tsu Yen.

501
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,706
It can't be a sex offender, right?

502
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,874
Dating the perpetrator of your case.

503
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,711
Do you know what will happen if this gets out?

504
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,613
Gi.

505
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,349
It really is you.

506
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,550

672
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,640
Hello?

673
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,110
Kao Chen Wei hasn't gone back home yet?

674
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,613
Do you know where Chung Yun Wen is?

675
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,650
Okay...I understand.

676
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,851
Thanks.

677
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,722
Hey.

678
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,898
Hey!

679
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,866
Let me go!

680
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,870
Do you often carry baby oil

681
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,871
and give massages?

682
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,608
Hello?

683
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:45,442
Senior.

684
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,344
I'll have to trouble you with something.

685
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,779
My brother was just released on bail.

686
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,080
Could I trouble you to pick him up?

687
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,683
In the year since you started to interact with them,

688
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,586
the death toll of sex offenders rose significantly.

689
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,920
These are yours?

690
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,726
Are you looking for the rapist from back then?
