00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,388
My mom couldn't sleep all the time...

340
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,224
It's this bottle!

341
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,125
My mom couldn't sleep all the time

342
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,860
so I thought that I could give her sleeping pills

343
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,261
and she would become better.

344
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,431
Who knew...who knew that after she had taken half of it,

345
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,234
she had a convulsion in the middle of the night.

346
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,072
He was the one who put poison in this bottle.

347
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,442
Who was he trying to kill?

348
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,245
Is the name on the bottle your friend's name?

349
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,413
Gi Chun Ting.

350
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,783
Yes, that's him. Gi Chun Ting!

351
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,718
Do you have his contact number?

352
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,823
It's useless...he won't answer my call.

353
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,726
Okay...I'll take this for testing first.

354
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,062
Please, please.

355
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,105
[Please leave a message after the beep.]

356
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,708
Fan, I've reached.

357
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,743
Are you on the way?

358
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,745
I'll wait for you in front of the door.

359
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,293
I'm good friends with the clients here.

360
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,028
You must do a good job today.

361
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,831
Hurry up and go in.

362
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,101
Rooms 205 and 203, understand?

363
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,379
[Dabecon : I have chicks ready to be sent from the north district to the south district, no waiting required, do you want to go?]

364
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,501
Hello sister.

365
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,969
I'm home.

366
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,080
I want Panadol.

367
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,348
Okay please wait.

368
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,635
Granny, is Ning Ning home?

369
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:09,107
Granny, I have material for you to sign.

370
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,854
Why are your hands separated from your body?

371
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,291
Because sometimes I feel like my hands

372
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,226
aren't mine.

373
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,128
I just came here today to warn you.

374
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,397
Gi Chun Ting is not a good person.

375
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,133
If you get closer to him,

376
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,136
you will die a miserable death.

377
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,479
[Gi Chun Ting]

378
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,261
Shit.

379
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,479
[Brother Gi, I don't feel well today.]

380
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,281
[I originally wanted to stick it out.]

381
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,149
[But I couldn't in the end...]

382
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,684
[Sorry.]

383
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,221
How are you going to get home?

384
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,223
By bus.

385
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,658
I will eat something later.

386
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,660
I'm really so hungry, it's been a tiring day.

387
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,295
- I'm rushing to catch the bus, I'll go first.
- Be careful.

388
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,596
Okay bye.

389
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,964
I'll go this way.

390
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,032
Okay.

391
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,874
Why did you come here?

392
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,977
I called you but you didn't pick up.

393
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,413
Sorry I've been busy recently.

394
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,515
Let's go...I'll accompany you tonight.

395
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,052
Why do you look so strange?

396
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,788
Are you very tired? Have you been sleeping?

397
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,056
Me?

398
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,559
It's nothing.

399
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,429
I haven't seen you for two days

400
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,730
so I'm emotionally exhausted.

401
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,700
Stop flirting with me, it's annoying.

402
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,335
Okay let's go...get on the bike.

403
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,108

404
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,078
I'm back.

00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,025
Chi Hon.

407
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,297
Sorry...I was working late.

408
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,932
You must be starving to death.

409
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,834
I bought some vermicelli...get up and eat it.

410
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,227
Give me the bowl.

411
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,697
Eat more.

412
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,781
We can go home tomorrow.

413
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,983
I applied for long leave.

414
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,430
Elder sister.

415
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,535
Kuo Chun Yi said

416
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,539
he knew what happened to our eldest sister.

417
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,842
So I pled guilty.

418
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,953
He said that kind of thing and you believed him?

419
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,862
How could you be so foolish?

420
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,677
What do you want to eat later?

421
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,213
Anything is fine.

422
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,215
Let's order takeout then.

423
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,150
Takeout?

424
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,218
If it's convenient, can you help me see whether

425
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,320
there's anything delicious recently?

426
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,589
Okay takeout...

427
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,325
I'll order it later.

428
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,066
You didn't wash the pots again.

429
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,173
After we eat,

430
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,709

Why was she looking for him?

437
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,929
Boss, I've asked around.

The one with a daughter?

442
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,339
They broke up.

443

in the district.

465

He had criminal records of robbery and sexual assault.

He usually abided by the rules

467

and didn't have any records of breaking them.

468

there was a case of sexual assault.

00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:21,986
About the policeman in charge of the case,

509
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:22,787
even though it isn't relevant to the material

510
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,789
To the info I wanted

511
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,289
but because he is

512
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,791
a victim of my case,

513
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,825
I want to know

514
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,093
why he resigned.

515
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,390
Coming.

516
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,666
I brought beer.

517
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,138
What happened to your hands?

518
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,941
Come in and talk.

519
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:17,942
Help me to close the door.

520
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:18,943
Okay.

521
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,484
So you staked out that place for three days?

522
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,620
Yes.

523
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,956
But in the end I still let him escape.

524
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,962
Can I ask you some questions?

525
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,697
Yes.

526
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,069
The policeman in charge then, Kuo Chung Ren.

527
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,704
Do you still remember him?

528
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,441
I remember.

529
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,909
I just want to ask you why you can't release

530
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,344
the list of sex offenders.

531
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,879
Who exactly are you all protecting?

532
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:55,613
The person you are protecting

533
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,014
is that bastard!

534
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,883
They can sexually assault people all they want.

535
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,084
But when his dead body

536
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,185
appeared in front of me,

537
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,453
I couldn't recognize him.

538
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,989
So you know that the dead person in the taxi is him?

539
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,092
I found out later.

540
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,762
Kuo Chung Ren's performance appraisal wasn't good in the first place.

541
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,297
He often made mistakes.

542
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,199
When the girl who was raped

543
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,734
reported the crime,

544
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,036
coincidentally he was on duty then, and he didn't handle the matter well.

545
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,372
How long have you been a cop?

546
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,107
Even putting the specimen in the cooler...

547
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,275
something so simple...

548
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,210
I still have to teach you.

549
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,112
Was it because of this case that Kuo Chung Ren

550
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,747
was forced to resign?

551
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,917
He received a major demerit point because of this incident.

552
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:33,751
Later, because

553
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,786
the list of sex offenders who were being monitored in the district

554
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,421
were released on the Internet

555
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,024
and the investigations revealed that it was leaked using his account.

556
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,158
Even though he didn't admit it

557
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,293
and said that it was the student from Ming Ren University

558
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,761
who hacked into his computer,

559
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,330
but we had no choice, with this type of violation.

560
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,600
So in the end he got another two major demerit points and was dismissed.

561
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,137
Using his account to release

562
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,772
the list of sex offenders,

563
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,174
was it done by you too?

564
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,945
It's Chung Yun Wen...he has a friend who is a hacker.

565
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,248
You were taking revenge on him

566
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,584
because he was negligent in dealing with the case.

567
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,886
Get out if you're not here to report the case!

568
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,688
Don't touch me...I'll leave of my own accord.

569
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,089
You're not releasing it today, right?

570
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,158
No matter, I'll do it myself!

571
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,164
How can this be considered as revenge?

572
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,966
The police was supposed to release the information in the first place

573
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,435
to alert nearby students of danger.

574
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:27,972
So you and your friends in the mystery club

575
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,840
were involved in this.

576
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,609
Did the people who beat up the sex offender together with you

577
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,277
include the three of them?

578
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,350
I forgot whether Chung Yun Wen and Goose went.

579
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,186
But Xiao Lan didn't, she was quite a few years younger.

580
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,834
Do you still think that they were the ones who framed you?

581
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,212
That day, you suddenly mentioned my dad.

582
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,881
I guess you also read their

583
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,416
masterpiece that won first prize.

584
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,752
I read it too.

585
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,590
After reading, I felt that

586
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,694
they were so childish

587
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,031
and so unfamiliar.

588
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,967
I don't even know what nonsense they were writing.

589
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,239
Let me show you something.

590
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,544
After that, I re-organised everything one more time.

591
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,247
Now I feel

592
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,082
maybe it really

593
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,051
has nothing to do with those three people.

594
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,689
Now the most likely suspect is

595
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,925
the rapist who escaped back then.

596
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,927
He knew that I was looking for him

597
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:58,929
so he used Kuo Chung Ren to contact me.

598
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,265
Then he killed Kuo Chung Ren

599
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,000
with the intention of framing me.

600
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,270
He probably knows now

601
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,806
that we've found out where he collected the books.

602
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,741
So this place

603
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,276
should be the focus of our investigation.

604
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,214
You were looking for the rapist from back then?

605
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,598
Mister Chung.

606
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,599
The car that you were asking about just now

607
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,234
with licence plate BCM has been driven away.

608
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:38,602
Chang Ting Lan.

609
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:39,903
The list of addresses that the goods were delivered to that day.

610
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,038
Where did you put it?

611
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,574
How do we find the kid you mentioned?

612
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,442
What are you doing? Don't...

613
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:46,977
Brother Gi!

614
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,514
Ghost!

615
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,317
Come out!

616
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,087
The glove?

617
00:45:58,856 --> 00:45:59,556
Welcome.
