"The Decagon House Murders"

12
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:44,709

13
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:48,334
It's novel writer Ayatsuji Yukito's
first long-form novel.

who went to an isolated island.

Did I interrupt you?

65
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,876
The sign outside did not say "out for
a break" and the door wasn't locked.

00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,542
So, I came in.

Are you looking for me?

I listened to your podcast.

74
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,584
It was about "The Decagon House Murders".

75
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:25,999
I haven't read it before.

76
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,641
You have to, it's a classic.

77
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,542
Ayatsuji Yukito was inspired by
Agatha Christine's "And Then There Were None"

78
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,083
before writing this novel.

79
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,083
It's the classic Snowstorm Villa Model.

This is the latest re-translated edition.

81

The killing methods you mentioned includes...

82
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,375
Strangulation, body burning...

83
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,584
And chopping off the victim's left hand, right?

84
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:51,500
Right.

85
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,999
However, the killing methods you mentioned
were pulled from a few murder cases.

86
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,292
You combined the different killing methods

87
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,125
and mentioned them together.

Do you know that matches

114
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,999
are great micro evidence?

115
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,876
Match heads contain diatoms.

116
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,999
There are more than 8000 diatoms in the world.

117
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,292
Each of them has a unique look and structure.

118
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,584
So different brands of matches,

119
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,417
almost never contain the same components.

120
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:51,936
So...

121
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,167
By analyzing the type of diatoms,

122
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:58,250
we can identify which brand it is.

I actually like older women.

That was why I got into a
relationship with Ning's mom.

313

Who knew she had mental issues.

314
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,209
She kept saying I molested her daughter.

315
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:27,999
If you didn't do it,

316

why did she say that?

317

At first, I also didn't know why.

318

Then, I figured it out.

319
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,042
She was jealous.

320
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:47,083
Jealous of girls who are prettier and younger than her.

321
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:50,125
That's why she kept
imagining me having affairs.

322
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:53,470
You didn't?

323
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,162
No, I didn't.

324
00:21:55,162 --> 00:21:56,495
I swear.

325
00:21:57,826 --> 00:22:01,042
I was just not ready for marriage.

326
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,792
We were together for just two months

327
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,999
and she asked me to marry her.

328
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,881
At that point of time, I just got out of jail.

329

I should at least find a job first.

330

00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,083
You didn't tell the judge any of this?

341
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:54,999
I didn't plead guilty,

342
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,241
but I also didn't tell them
what really happened.

343
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:01,148
Why would you do that?

344
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:04,649
Don't you know there would be records?

345
00:23:05,396 --> 00:23:06,936
There is no difference.

346
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,292
I was a guarantor for my friend,

347
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,459
and I ended up in jail for a few months.

348
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:16,878
After I got out, I didn't blame my friend.

349
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,710
I feel like the connections we make

350
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,669
means more than any criminal record.

351
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:27,999
Just like now, I work at a gym.

352
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:31,209
I'm not some good guy who's perfect.

353
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,155
My dad left home for someone
when I was young.

354
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,999
My mom didn't take care of me.

355
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:46,042
I would go out and steal food
after being hungry for days.

356
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,083
Sometimes when I'm lucky,

357
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,500
I get to eat my neighbor's leftovers.

358
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,584
I've been through these kind of days.

359
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,334
So when I saw a girl like Ning.

360
00:23:58,334 --> 00:24:00,709
I really felt sorry for her.

361
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:06,999
So I would do whatever that's good for her.

362
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:25,999
It's fine...

363
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:29,709
What?

364
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,125
Y-Your hand's warm.

365
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,083
Why's your face so red?

366
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,209
Are you drunk?

367
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,626
N-No.

368
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:39,999
I'm gonna go.

369
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,999
Can we still contact each other after this?

370
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,459
I'll think about it.

371
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:49,792
Thank you.

372
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:54,834
I'm really happy that you're willing to consider.

373
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,417
Yun Wen, you're off work?

374
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:06,125
- Goodbye, Dean.
- Bye.

375
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,667
Dr. Chung, you have a package.

376
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:14,125
Thanks.

377
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,250
Dr. Chung, what a coincidence.

378
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,083
I'm here to look for you.

379
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,999
Can I talk to you for a bit?

380
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:32,083
I think I didn't receive a subpoena.

381
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,834
Sorry, I don't have it.

382
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,167
But I'm not here to ask about your student.

383
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,834
I'm here for you.

384
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:46,202
I remember it was raining hard.

385
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:50,928
After I sent Chang Ting Lan back home...

386
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:53,999
I went back with Wen Tsu Yen
and we stayed in for the night.

387
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:57,936
You and Wen Tsu Yen are...?

388
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:02,404
We're roommates.

389
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,682
How did you four know each other?

390
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:11,607
We were in the same mystery club in college.

391
00:26:11,607 --> 00:26:13,540
Kao Chen Wei was our senior.

392
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,732
Wen Tsu Yen and I were in the same year.

393
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,231
Chang Ting Lan was my junior.

394
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,746
Can you check if I wrote
their names correctly?

395
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:27,626
Then... why didn't Kao Chen Wei
leave with you guys that day?

396
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,468
He entered a mystery novel contest.

397
00:26:31,468 --> 00:26:34,743
That night, he wanted to
stay back to write more.

398
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:45,751
Did you know that

399
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:49,584
he witnessed a murder on his way home?

400
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:57,876
Ting Lan.

401
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,092
Yes?

402
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:01,626
When I was checking our inventory today,

403
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:04,626
I realised there were 5 or 6
missing "Stuffy Nose".

404
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,500
Were they stolen?

405
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,292
"Stuffy Nose?"

406
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,897
How many boxes can I take?

407
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,667
Two at most.

408
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,167
I'll get your inhaler.

409
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,083
Sis, did you get it?

410
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:19,709
Here's what I think,

411
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:21,999
I'll contact the security company later

412
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:23,999
for camera footages.

413
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:26,959
M-Manager, sorry!

414
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,751
I bought them for my brother.

415
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:30,843
I forgot to write it down, sorry.

416
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:32,669
Why did he need this many?

417
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,125
He has allergic rhinitis. He needs them often.

418
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,999
- I'll write them down now.
- Okay.

419
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:38,999
Sorry.

420
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,881
Lan, did you see the ranking?

421
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,382
No, why?

422
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,334
Still no.4.

423
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:00,000
It's top three or nothing.

424
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,610
There's still time to vote.

425
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,726
I think the last chapter is very interesting.

426
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:08,773
Moreover, there are people

427
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:11,701
who would wait until all chapters
are released to read it in one sitting.

428
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:14,999
So I think there'll be
more fans in the last week.

429
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:16,209
Right?

430
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:17,542
There's still a chance.

431
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:21,042
Wen.

432
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:27,866
Why are you here?

433
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,899
I can't come when I want to?

434
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:34,484
I need your permission?

435
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:37,973
You didn't come last week when I asked.

436
00:28:37,973 --> 00:28:39,515
Who would dare to ask again?

437
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:43,999
I really had work to do last week.

438
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:45,918
Sorry, alright?

439
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:47,999
Why didn't Yun Wen come?

440
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:50,125
He isn't feeling well today.

441
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:58,999
Wei.

442
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,266
I'm almost done here, I'm leaving now.

443
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:03,234
- You're going back?
- Yes.

444
00:29:03,234 --> 00:29:04,234
Okay.

445
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:05,999
Be careful.

446
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:06,999
Okay.

447
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:07,999
Bye, Wei.

448
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:08,999
Bye.

449
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:21,250
What's wrong?

450
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,209
An ADA came to me

451
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,000
and said you witnessed a murder.

452
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:38,834
Yes.

453
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,042
I did.

454
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:43,125
But...

455
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,709
Why did she go to you?

456
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:52,015
Don't know.

457
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,083
She asked if there was anything unusual about you.

458
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,667
Is she suspecting you?

459
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:05,292
Nothing to suspect.

460
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,667
I just passed by on my way home.

461
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,796
Why didn't you say anything?

462
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:14,877
Say what?

463
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,999
You were in a murder scene.

464
00:30:19,753 --> 00:30:22,233
This is such a serious thing
and you didn't say anything to us.

465
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,691
Wei.

466
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:27,280
Are you going to investigate this alone?

467
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:30,540
It's not a game.

468
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,248
What really happened?

469
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,999
If you were just a witness,

470
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:46,918
why would the police suspect you?

471
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:49,274
You are overthinking.

472
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,042
Why would they suspect me?

473
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:57,340
By the way, I don't think I can
talk to you about the crime scene.

474
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,131
You were questioned by the police.

475
00:31:00,709 --> 00:31:02,512
What's wrong with being questioned?

476
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,263
You think I might be involved?

477
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,999
First it was "the Ghost".

478
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,167
Now this.

479
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,999
What did I do to you?

480
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:16,910
Someone was trying to frame me

481
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,935
but he didn't succeed.

482
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:20,935
I'll hunt him down.

483
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,999
Don't let Lan and Goose know that

484
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:32,042
you were questioned by the police.

485
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,999
You're always like this...

486
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,373
thinking people are out here to get you.

487
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:39,623
What is this?

488
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:44,643
It's beer that my friend's investing in.

489
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,891
Didn't you say you wanted to
sell beer in the book store?

490
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:48,931
Have a taste.

491
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:51,810
Maybe it can help with
the bookstore's income.

492
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:55,604
When did you start caring about the bookstore?

493
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,209
Wei.

494
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,999
When people are nice to you,

495
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:01,655
just say thank you.

496
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:03,305
Don't be so defensive.

497
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:05,754
I'll help you take some pictures,
you can start selling them later.

498
00:32:05,754 --> 00:32:07,087
Excuse me.

499
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:09,346
I'm not as nice as you.

500
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,221
We're different people.

501
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,558
You got a new phone?

502
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,334
Yes, I broke the old one.

503
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:30,459
My Health Bureau account

504
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:31,999
seemed to have been hacked.

505
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:33,709
Someone logged on it.

506
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:43,292
Be careful.

No, I have my own.

No.

That's weird.

518
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:59,545
I signed up for this gym today.

519
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,902
Someone gave me a coupon.

- What's this class?
- Hold on tightly, good.

521
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,063
- It's TRX.
- Down... Up.

522
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:08,108
- It's a suspension system
- Keep your feet firmly planted.

523
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,118
that uses your own body

I didn't believe him completely.

I'm still observing.

Yes, already trying to get fit

When you went to the bookstore today

558
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:50,999
was Wei angry because I didn't go?

559
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:54,834
He was super mad.

Let me tell you,
I was gonna talk to you about this.

He was super angry when you didn't go last time.

562
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:01,999
He even asked if we were "the Ghost".

563
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:03,125
Do I look good?

564
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,869
He asked if I were "the Ghost" too.

565

He even asked me to investigate it for him.
How do I even do that?

00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:42,034
Give me one million dollars.

677
00:42:43,138 --> 00:42:44,928
And let me pass the next evaluation.

678
00:42:45,873 --> 00:42:47,083
Or your pictures...

679
00:42:54,209 --> 00:42:55,918
I will give them to the police.

680
00:42:56,638 --> 00:42:59,803
You will live in shame for the rest of your life.

681
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:14,626
You look pretty hot in a dress.

682
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:16,537
I'm hard now.

683
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:19,159
I've never tried this before.

684
00:43:23,082 --> 00:43:24,707
You want to do it or should I?

685
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:29,881
Turn around.

686
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:32,081
Turn around.

687
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:33,681
Turn around!

688
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:54,012
The more you resist it, the more I like it.

689
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:11,167
It feel so good.

690
00:44:16,975 --> 00:44:18,252
If you don't let me pass...

691
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,083
Take it off!

692
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,375
Push him down...

693
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,385
Take them off...

694
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,709
Do you jerk off?

695
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:32,918
Hey! Do you jerk off?

696
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:34,000
It's not like we haven't seen it before.

697
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,304
- Are you hard already?
- Idiot, don't talk like this.

698
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:39,709
Hurry.

699
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:41,292
Get the ruler.

700
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:47,667
Are you hard already?

701
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,876
Idiot, don't struggle.

702
00:44:52,876 --> 00:44:55,834
Are you gonna cry?

703
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:31,896
[Preview]
Last time you asked me to find out

704
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,417
who "the Ghost" is, and I found it.

705
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,500
That's not who my guy found.

706
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,167
Maybe someone from the mystery club.

707
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,626
I know.

708
00:45:38,626 --> 00:45:40,292
Maybe it's Chu?

709
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:47,918
Come in.

710
00:45:47,918 --> 00:45:49,999
I've said it before, don't come into my room!

711
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,667
You can't go there!

712
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:55,792
Why?

713
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:56,990
There are ghosts there.

714
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,907
I think I found the primary crime scene.
