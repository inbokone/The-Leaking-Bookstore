Chun, sorry I'm late.

171
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,862
Can you help me check
my appointments for today?

172
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,698
- Sure, wait a second.
- Dr. Chung.

173
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:05,799
Mr. Ku Yu Hon is here.

174
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,434
I've already brought him upstairs.

175
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,976
An officer from the Health Bureau

176
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,345
told me something happened.

177
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,948
But I still want to hear

178
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:25,385
your side of the story.

179

I just downloaded some pictures.

180
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,262
I didn't spread them.

181
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,466
How was that illegal?

182
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,403
Besides, nowadays there's
pornography everywhere on the internet.

183
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:47,273
Who knows which one is illegal?

184
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,042
It's too ridiculous.

185
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,178
The pictures you mentioned...

186
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,914
were of child sexual abuse.

[Over-reacting]

Can you share with me
why you want to collect them?

189
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,403
Aren't you a psychiatrist?

190
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,775
I think psychiatrists

191
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,878
shouldn't do the jobs of the police.

192
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,614
Yes.

193
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,284

194
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,054
In therapy, we use psychology

195
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,989
to help us change.

196
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,490
When your feelings change,

197
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,325
your behaviors change too.

198
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,529
So I want to know,

199
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,798
how do you feel about what you did,

200
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,233
and how it makes you feel.

201
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,334
That way, I can understand

202
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,270
how I can help you.

203
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:00,880
As you can see,

204
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,816
this was what Ning first drew.

205
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,919
There's a hint of blood and violence.

206
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,122
Like how her hands and body are apart.

207
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,658
There's even a weapon in her hand.

208
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,359
She drew this one recently.

209
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,195
Based on the drawing, we can see that

210
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,831
there are a lot more cute animals.

211
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,199
It has come to my attention that

212
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,401
her mother has mental health issues

213
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,969
and she regularly needs to stay in an institute.

214
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,672
So her main caretaker is her grandmother.

215
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,774
I've visited her home before.

216
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:29,943
From what I know,

217
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,046
all your pictures can't be found

218
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,215

That's right.

223
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,186

the downloaded pictures.

You face is so red.

He wouldn't give me a prescription.

325
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,784
Didn't want to get in trouble.

326
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,521
Don't think too much.

327
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,156
Usually on the first visit,

328
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,525
doctors need to do more evaluation.

329
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,262

330
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,297

341
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,998
Nothing.

342
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,202
Teacher, what happened?

343
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:36,030
I need you to help me.

344
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,046
[Expired pills]

345
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,351
How many can I take.

346
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,586
Two boxes at most.

347
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,151
Lan,

348
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,159
I got a call from the Health Bureau.

349
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,527
They'll come early.

350
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,696
Hurry up and deal with these expired pills.

351
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,657
Make sure it's handled properly.

352
00:19:58,657 --> 00:19:59,724
Okay.

353
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:45,612
Thanks to everyone's support,

354
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,248
"Big Yellow Cab" has climbed to No.3.

355
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,649
Thank you everyone!

356
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:53,163
The poll will end in a few days' time.

357
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:56,156
Fans that liked our story,
please help us share and promote!

358
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:57,724
That's the end of our live stream.

359
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,255
See you next time.

360
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:01,328
Bye.

361
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,642
Why didn't Goose show up?

362
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,911
She…

363
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,246
She fell in love.

364
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:22,749
Really?

365
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,152
Wei, are you jealous?

366
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:26,286
Me?

367
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,554
Of course not.

368
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:30,724
With whom?

369
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,325
How would I know.

370
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,461
Someone from work I guess.

371
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,897
Probably another asshole.

372
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:38,732
You're all sweaty.

373
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:40,757
Bye!

374
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,048
You're awake.

375
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:57,817
Are you feeling better?

376
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,187
Are you?

377
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:02,355
Take it slow.

378
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,291
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine…

379
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,126
What time is it?

380
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,663
It's almost eight thirty now.

381
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:11,932
Thank you.

382
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,406
If you still feel unwell,

383
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,208
you can stay longer.

384
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:25,946
I don't know.

385
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,682
My head is pounding.

386
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:34,221
Shall I... Rub it for you?

387
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:40,360
If you don't mind...

388
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:45,498
Here?

389
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:50,971
Relax.

390
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,541
Did I press too hard?

391
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,775
No.

392
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,980
Relax and breathe.

393
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,489
Feel better?

394
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,724
Yes.

395
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,295
Thanks, sorry to bother you.

396
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:16,896
It's fine…

397
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,098
By the way, Wei.

398
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:21,935
Last time… You asked me
to track who's "the Ghost".

399
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:23,470
I found it.

400
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,277
His IP address matches with
one of the accounts in the forum.

401
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:33,280
So... He should be a student
from National Central University.

402
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,115
How did you find him?

403
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:40,520
My friend hacked into…
the publisher's website.

404
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,673
Thanks for today.

405
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm sorry.

406
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,142
It's fine.

407
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:04,411
Why don't you take a day off.

408
00:24:04,411 --> 00:24:07,739
You're still going to work
despite feeling unwell?

409
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,432
Okay.

410
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:14,421
Can you let me know when you're home?

411
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,424
If I know you're safely home,

412
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,826
I'll feel more at ease.

413
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,696
Okay.

414
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:25,065
Bye.

415
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:26,166
Bye.

416
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,973
That's weird.

417
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,975
My guy found a different IP address.

418
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,510
You asked someone else?

419
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,812
Yes.

420
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,214
Who is it?

421
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,350
Not sure.

422
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:47,620
But the IP's from Ming Ren University.

423
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,458
Maybe someone from the mystery club.

424
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:52,959
Mystery club…

425
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,362
I know.

426
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:56,896
Maybe it's Chu?

427
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,133
Chu... What is he called?

428
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:01,201
Chu Shue Jin.

429
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,235
Yes, Chu Shue Jin.

430
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,237
He left the club after the experiment.

431
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:06,272
Remember?

432
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,874
That's possible.

433
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,310
Was he okay?

434
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,412
I haven't really kept in touch with him.

435
00:25:12,412 --> 00:25:14,013
But I have his Facebook.

436
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,216
He still works in the school's administration.

437
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:18,651
What if he got after-effects from it?

438
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,854
Like losing his hearing...

439
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:23,656
It might actually be him.

440
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,224
His condition was pretty serious right?

441
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,429
Has he posted anything lately?

442
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,965
I didn't pay attention.

443
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,206
I'm done drawing.

444
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,875
This is us talking while sitting on a chair.

445
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,309
I didn't draw well.

446
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:46,346
I don't think so.
I think you drew really well.

447
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:47,814
What are these two circles?

448
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:50,784
These… Are our angels.

449
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:53,553
They know what we are thinking about.

450
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,355
Are both our angels talking?

451
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:59,559
Does that mean…

452
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,362
I can guess what's on your mind?

453
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:04,164
I think so.

454
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:06,332
- Let me guess.
- Sure.

455
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,935
I sense...

456
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,438
You've been wanting a Switch since long ago.

457
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:12,806
How do you know?

458
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:15,909
Happy birthday!

459
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,012
Do you like it?

460
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,914
Yes!

461
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,949
But it's not from me.

462
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:24,818
It's from Uncle Gi.

463
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,729
Ning, let me tell you...

464
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:40,500
You can decide for yourself
if you want to receive this gift.

465
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,835
Even if you take it,

466
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:44,737
it doesn't mean that you
have to forgive uncle Gi

467
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,739
or listen to him.

468
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,308
You owe him nothing.

469
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:50,944
Shouldn't I say thank you to him?

470
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,480
Sure, sure…

471
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,315
If you want to thank him,

472
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:59,352
I'll find something for you to write on.

473
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:02,755
- Okay.
- Okay, wait for me.

474
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,300
Just stop here.

475
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,072
Thanks.

476
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,412
I almost forgot.

477
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,515
This is a card from Ning.

478
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,885
Ning wrote it for me?

479
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,156
[Thank you uncle Gi]

480
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:39,893
Take good care of it.

481
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,896
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go now, bye.

482
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,265
Wait.

483
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:49,002
Can we talk a little?

484
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,672
Now? Here?

485
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:55,041
Just five minutes, is it okay?

486
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,926
Come in.

487
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:15,762
You can leave your shoes there.

488
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,522
It's just going to take
a few minutes, right?

489
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:24,571
Goose, you're back?

490
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:27,674
Goose!

491
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,310
Wait… The shoes, careful.

492
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,945
Goose!

493
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:33,780
You're back?

494
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,881
Goose?

495
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:37,317
Auntie.

496
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:40,353
- You're back.
- You're home?

497
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:43,222
You're all wet. Dry yourself
or you're gonna catch a cold.

498
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,824
Okay.

499
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,326
I was gonna play Mahjong,
it got cancelled.

500
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:47,994
So I came back.

501
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:50,599
You gave me too much for the rent!

502
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,065
It's not easy for young
people like you to earn money.

503
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,000
Count before you pay me.

504
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,602
- Take it.
- Thanks, auntie.

505
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:56,636
Thank you.

506
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,707
Yun Wen didn't come back with you?

507
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,910
Y-Yun Wen? No, no!

508
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,647
I think he's still at work.

509
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:12,986
Here's what I think.

510
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:15,622
Both of you are not that young anymore,

511
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:17,790
