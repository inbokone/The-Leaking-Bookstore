174
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,074
Mind your own business.

175
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,043
Treat it like you didn't saw anything, go.

176
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,311
Treat it like you didn't see anything.

177
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,253
You dare to try anything else, come here...come here.

178
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,457
Who is that?

179
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,226
Go, go, hurry.

180
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,595
Come here!

181
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,896
Continue talking nonstop,

182
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,364
continue telling me what you think--

183
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,999
Don't touch me!

184
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,367
Do as I say, be quiet!

185
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,136
Otherwise I'm telling you, I'll kill you.

186
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,305
What's happening?

187
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,673
Look at that girl.

188
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,375
Don't make me angry.

189
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,343
What are you doing?

190
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,045
Why is he dragging her?

191
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:06,612
What?

192
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,680
Go!

193
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,015
You want to die, is it?

194
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,918
Chung Yun Wen!

195
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,153
Sorry.

196
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,487
Idiot!

197
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,123
I'm telling you, keep your mouth shut.

198
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,725
If you say anything stupid, you're dead.

199
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,898
Miss, are you okay?

200
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,533
None of your business.

201
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,168
- Wait, what about Gi Chun Ting?
- Let go of me!

202
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:29,869
What about Gi Chun Ting?

203
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,503
Why are you like this?

204
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,038
So what? Get lost!

205
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,775
No, why did you mention Gi Chun Ting?

206
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,677
What happened to Gi Chun Ting?

207
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,847
Chung Yun Wen.

208
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,649
Who is that woman?

209
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,321
What happened? Did something happen to Gi Chun Ting?

210
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,953
Fine.

211
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,556
I'll move out.

212
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,406
Do you only want to wash your hair today?

213
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,640
Yes, just a hair wash.

214
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,808
You have a date?

215
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,376
Eating with a guest.

216
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,844
I'll make you look prettier.

217
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,246
Thanks.

218
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,186
Are you taking the plant back?

219
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,289
No, if I bring it back I'll forget to water it

220
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,191
and my younger brother won't help me take care of it.

221
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,194
You can grow it but not water it.

222
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,412
[It's about time]

223
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,460
I'll wait for you outside.

224
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,557
[Chung Yun Wen]

225
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,427
The number you dialed is not available.

226
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,867
Senior.

227
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,802
I have something urgent to tell you.

228
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,370
Call me back, okay?

229
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,606
Also,

230
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,509
I want to talk about what happened with the novel.

231
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,010
I really didn't think that

232
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,513
you would think that way.

233
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,416
Call me back.

234
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,918
[Gi Chun Ting sent you a picture]

235
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,890
[Brother Gi, why did you disappear? Call me if you've got clients, tell them 30K for SM (sadomasochism), I'm scared, help me to do it okay? I'll wait for you, miss you.]
[Call me on my other phone later]

236
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,325
[Don't be surprised, yesterday I saw the report, the doctor said my breast cancer has already progressed to stage three, you can't help me much anymore]

237
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,661
[Brother Gi, there would be nothing better in this world if you could help me]
[I understand, I'll contact you later]

238
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,296
Because I saw

239
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,698
that you contacted Gi Jun Ting.

240
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,234
I want to understand what's going on.

241
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,404
Chauffeur?

242
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,874
You said that

243
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,011
because he used to pick up and drop off the kid's mom...

244
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,448
[You are Brother Gi's girlfriend right,]

245
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,550
(In case you misunderstood)

246
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,952
[The above messages are what I sent him]

247
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,687
My boss knows that

248
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,023
my condition hasn't been good recently.

249
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,425
So he may transfer me elsewhere.

250
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,260
Why do you look so strange today?

251
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,361
Are you very tired?

252
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,230
Did you sleep?

253
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,866
I came here today to warn you.

254
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,135
Gi Chun Ting is not a good person.

255
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,604
If you get closer to him,

256
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,140
you will die a miserable death.

257
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,108
I really miss you.

258
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,312
Want to spend more time with you.

259
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,826
Please eat first.

260
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,794
Thank you Yun Wen.

261
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,462
You've bought back lunch?

262
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,301
I bought lunch for you.

263
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,806
Goose.

264
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,377
Hurry up and open the door.

265
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,514
I knew Gi Chun Ting early on.

266
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,121
Didn't our senior read "To Be Loved"?

267
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,392
In the end,

268
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,197
I seem to have discovered something from ten years ago.

269
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,268
I thought it was a bit scary.

270
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,538
But you were dating.

271
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,740
I didn't know who to tell.

272
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,874
I couldn't find you either.

273
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,309
So I really didn't mean to

274
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,845
say those things, okay?

275
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,247
Open the door and talk.

276
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,754
I'm sorry.

277
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,405
Miss Lin.

278
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,606
Mister Chung.

279
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,742
Just now, that "BCM" that you wanted has been driven away.

280
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,277
He left?

281
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,011
Didn't I tell you

282
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,646
to call me when you see him?

283
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,915
No, he drove across the street,

284
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,083
picked up someone and left.

285
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,384
I couldn't stop him, bro.

286
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,153
Okay...now he's...did you take photos?

287
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,021
Send them to me now, okay?

288
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,804
Are the results of the comparative analysis out?

289
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,608
Okay I'll go over now.

290
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,623
This is something that I'm quite curious about.

291
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,659
When you volunteer in schools

292
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,061
and play with the kids there,

293
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,297
will you think about the photos?

294
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,466
When I was fifteen years old,

295
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,202
I told my parents

296
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,837
I suspect that

297
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,039
I might be gay.

298
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,377
Have you heard of anyone who got caught masturbating

299
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,779
by their mom?

300
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,630
Hello Chung Yun Wen, what happened?

301
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,332
Hello, ADA Lin?

302
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,234
I have a very important issue on hand.

303
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,280
Hello?

304
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,386
Goose!

305
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,557
Open the door, Goose.

306
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,793
Something has happened!

307
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,261
What?

308
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,730
Take your phone.

309
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,864
Hurry up, I'll tell you on the way!

310
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,332
It's serious!

311
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,634
What's wrong?

312
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,906
How is this person driving?

313
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,041
Does he know how to drive? So scary, he hit someone.

314
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:03,875
Are you hurt?

315
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,377
Do you need me to call an ambulance for you?

316
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,179
I'm fine.

317
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,516
Welcome.

318
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,617
Here, come in.

319
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,087
Call for a bottle of red wine.

320
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,023
Don't be nervous.

321
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,631
Hello, is this Hong Chan Car Rental Co. Ltd?

322
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,866
Yes, good morning sir.

323
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,268
I'm an accountant from Hao Yu Precision Industry.

324
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,002
I called last time

325
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,537
and asked about a black Mercedes.

326
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,872
We regularly rent it from you.

327
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:07,539
Yes.

328
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,742
The license plate number is BCM1555.

329
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,410
I want to ask...

330
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,949
I want to confirm one...

331
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,352
Please continue.

332
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,588
Did you rent it out?

333
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,656
Excuse me, I'm driving.

334
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,091
I'll call you later.

335
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,659
Okay, thank you.

336
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,695
How do I ask?

337
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,231
Gosh, if it's like this now, where will you drive to?

338
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,500
How are we going to find that kid you mentioned?

339
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,069
I can only go directly to the rental company to see.

340
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,577
I seem to have thought of someone that I can ask.

341
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,678
Who are you going to ask?

342
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,047
Wait, let me try.

343
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,452
Who are you asking?

344
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,421
Wait, I...
[That...sorry, an emergency situation arose, you were the only person I could think of asking...have you met a client who drives a black Mercedes? If it's not convenient to reply it's okay...]

345
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,261
Did you get an answer?
[I've met the driver of the black Mercedes before, this person is very perverted, but he's also generous with his money, for the most part he goes to one hotel]

346
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,030
She said she has met the driver of the black Mercedes before.

347
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,298
Also that man is very perverted

348
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,033
but generous with money.

349
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,634
He always goes to one hotel.

350
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,302
Hotel?

351
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:10,669
Yes

352
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:11,603
Ask her which hotel.

353
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,238
Okay I'll ask her, wait.
[Which hotel?]

354
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,373
You ask her first, I'll pull over here.

355
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,313
How? Did she answer?

356
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,614
Not yet.

357
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,391
[Do you know where Gi Chun Ting is?]

358
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,331
[No.]

359
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,109
Here's the address.

360
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,812
Google it.

361
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,930
Hello, you're this breathless? Please.

362
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,332
How breathless are you?

363
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,767
Aren't you an amazing person?

364
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,735
Stand up and talk.

365
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,869
Are you a mute?

366
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,304
- The car is here.
- Okay.

367
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,538
He can't breathe till this extent.

368
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,773
What's the status now?

369
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,309
Okay it's about time, pack up our stuff.

370
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,543
We should go, let's go.

371
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,812
We'll let you go this time, watch out.

372
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,049
Pack it up.

373
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,417
Pack it up, don't let people see.

374
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,518
Pack it up well.

375
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,229
How? Feels good to have some exercise, right?

376
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,531
Where's the result of the comparative analysis?

377
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,565
It's out.

378
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,302
From Chen Shin Pharmacy, the mystery bookstore

379
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,604
and Chang Ting Lan's home.

380
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,339
Based on our information about the positions of these places, we can deduce that

381
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,440
it is Chang Ting Lan.

382
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,911
I'll call the DA (District Attorney) now

383
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,246
to get the search warrant.

384
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,380
We'll head out immediately.

385
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,181
Yes.

386
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,916
Teams A, B, C, D stand by.

387
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,118
Hello, DA?

388
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,553
Yes.

389
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,753
Is it the red wine?

390
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,491
Where's the red wine?

391
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,223
Hey.

392
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,159
Why are you pushing the cart out?

393
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,729
I'm bringing the discarded towels for recycling.

394
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,865
These look new.

395
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,434
Don't throw them away arbitrarily, it's very wasteful--

396
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,579
Help me to open the trunk.

397
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:44,816
Who is he?

398
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:45,917
You don't need to bother.

399
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,118
Help me lift and put him into the trunk.

400
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,186
Sister, this--

401
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,121
Hurry, don't ask so many questions for now.

402
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,892
Sister, what are you doing?

403
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,393
Then I'll go with you.

404
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,227
Just go home quickly.

405
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,762
Don't get involved.

406
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,000
Sister.

407
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:04,836
Sister!

408
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,377
["Ghost": You should know where to find me!]

409
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,600
Manager!

410
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,269
Manager.

411
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,317
Are you sure it's here?

412
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,253
Yes, it's here.

413
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,488
How do we find him?

414
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,491
Let's go in first.

415
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,225
Go in?

416
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,226
Yes.

417
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,528
Go in and find, what else can we do?

418
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,404
Hello.

419
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,373
Are you here for a long-term or short-term stay?

420
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,476
The door of the elevator is about to open.

421
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:52,911
The elevator is here!

422
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,246
Miss, is it Room 1126?

423
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,115
Yes, hurry.

424
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,254
Miss--

425
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:03,821
Brother Gi!

426
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,056
Why is there blood everywhere?

427
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,224
Hurry up and call the ambulance!

428
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,059
Okay wait for me, I'll call one now.

429
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,641
Do you know which room to look for?

430
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,281
We're looking for this kid.

431
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,631
All the doors here are closed, how are we going to find him?

432
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,490
Chung Yun Wen.

433
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,559
Look.

434
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,593
Is it him?

435
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,130
Little kid.

436
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,899
Little kid.

437
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,772
Little kid!

438
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,708
Little kid, wait.

439
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,776
Little kid.

440
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,513
Wait.

441
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,121
I just want to ask you a question.

442
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,956
I want to ask

443
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,091
if anyone hurt you?

444
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,061
Hurt me?

445
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:51,629
No.

446
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:52,864
No?

447
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,602
Just this.

448
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,011
After I drank something an uncle gave me,

449
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,413
I fell asleep.

450
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,151
I don't know how much time passed.

451
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,753
It seems like a young lady shook me awake.

452
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,856
But I was very dizzy.

453
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,325
I couldn't even open my eyes.

454
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,642
After I woke up,

455
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,344
I realised there was no one in the room.

456
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,547
I just saw the money

457
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,715
and this note.

458
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,787
This handwriting…

459
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,190
[Protect yourself. Don't do this sort of thing for money again. You might lose your life. Marlowe]

460
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,460
This is Lan's pen name, "Marlowe".

461
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,078
Is the store manager here?

462
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,814
Is there something that I can help with?

463
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,449
The police are investigating, please ask the store manager to come out.

464
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,917
Liu, quickly call the manager.

465
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,119
Manager.

466
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,254
Hello everyone, I'm the store manager.

467
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,856
I'm an ADA from the office of Shin Chow DA,

468
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,623
Lin Mu Chin.

469
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,924
We're looking for Chang Ting Lan.

470
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,226
Chang Ting...

471
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,695
Ting Lan hasn't come to work for a number of days.

472
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,730
Has something happened to her?

473
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,128
[Turn off your phone and leave it here.]

474
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,796
[Go to the place on the map alone]

475
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,666
[Please do as I say, I can see you]

476
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,201
["Ghost"]

477
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,761
[Hao Yu]

478
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,100
Pick up the phone.

479
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,437
Chung Yun Wen, I just thought of...

480
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,172
Do you remember there was once

481
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,073
we were discussing "To Be Loved"?

482
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:53,177
Then we were talking about the kid who wanted to take revenge.

483
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,346
Didn't Lan say something...

484
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:56,981
Let me sort everything out.

485
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,418
Now we're writing the part about the kid taking revenge.

486
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,553
About the place for revenge,

487
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,255
do you all have any ideas?

488
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,825
I thought of the beginning.

489
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,660
I'm counting on you all for the ending.

490
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,009
I know.

491
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,880
For the revenge, we should go back to the place where it all began.

492
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,651
That ruthless?

493
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,389
I think it's good.

494
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,156
This way,

495
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,758
the end of the story will echo the beginning.

496
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,792
Right.

497
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,495
Where it began...

498
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,079
I'll call Lan again.

499
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:02,680
Okay.

500
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,416
I'll try to reach her, if I can't get her I'll just have to find ways to reach her younger brother.

501
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,957
Hello Ya Wen, I'm Goose.

502
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,059
Can you help me find out

503
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,295
Chang Chi Hon's contact number?

504
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,563
Okay sorry to trouble you, thank you.

505
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,800
I've been busy with Chi Hon's matters.

506
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,536
Later I found out

507
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,138
that Kuo Chun Yi was

508
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,606
one of the cases you counselled in prison.

509
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:38,282
[From Gi: I heard Kuo Chun Yi was imprisoned, what happened?]

510
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,361
[Chung Yun Wen]

511
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,034
Hello?

512
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,502
Excuse me.

513
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,770
Is Gi Chun Ting beside you?

514
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,905
I have something extremely

515
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,640
important to ask him.

516
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,179
Is it for me?

517
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,088
Gi Chun Ting.

518
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,522
Hello.

519
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,658
Hello, is this Gi Chun Ting?

520
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:24,128
Do you know what is Chang Chi Hon's contact number?

521
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,498
I don't know.

522
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,367
What about Kuo Chun Yi?

523
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,268
How much do you know him?

524
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,002
Has he told you

525
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,771
anything about Chang Chi Hon?

526
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,774
I only know

527
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,045
he said that

528
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:45,683
he had an elder sister who was sexually assaulted.

529
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,918
His sister was sexually assaulted?

530
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,355
Did he tell you about the details?

531
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,824
Where? When did it happen?

532
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,894
Okay, okay I know.

533
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,162
Okay thank you.

534
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,732
Could it be related to Ching Yu's case?

535
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,478
I still don't understand why Lan would come here

536
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,581
and leave her pen name on this note.

537
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,616
That guy of surname Ku is a pedophile.

538
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,951
Wait.

539
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,052
Could he be the guy

540
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,254
who sexually assaulted Ching Yu that year?

541
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:00,191
So Lan was the one that took Mister Ku?

542
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,393
That pen name means that she was at the crime scene

543
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,828
and she saved that kid.

544
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:04,995
That's right.

545
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:05,796
Go straight?

546
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,897
Yes.

547
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,484
Ghost!

548
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:03,954
Come out!

549
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,664
Ghost!

550
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,146
A violin string?

551
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,782
What's all these for?

552
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,520
Gloves.

553
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,069
Hi.

554
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,959
Senior.

555
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,068
It's me.

556
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,804
"The Big Yellow Cab"

557
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,807
was initially a promising piece of work.

558
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,643
But the author missed out the most important part.

559
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,311
What a pity.

560
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,047
Senior.

561
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,314
This.

562
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,016
Auntie Lu's blood pressure medicine.

563
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:47,618
Thanks.

564
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,987
Senior, it's leaking inside as well.

565
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:50,788
Why is it leaking again?

566
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,289
The ceiling...

567
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,557
The rain is really big.

568
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:54,758
Be careful when you drive later.

569
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:55,993
Okay.

570
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,262
Senior, you're still not leaving?

571
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,631
I want to write more.

572
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:01,765
I still don't know what surprise that ghost has in store for me

573
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,934
after 8 hours.

574
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,137
Hey!

575
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,106
We separately

576
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,241
browsed different mystery novel forums.

577
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,110
All of them didn't have information about the Ghost.
[Do you think everything is about money? I only want the truth!]

578
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:14,812
Hey.

579
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,679
If  the Ghost

580
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,681
hadn't affected your online score,

581
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,517
maybe the judge would have really liked you.

582
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,520
Lan?

583
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,398
Don't touch me!

584
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,165
Don't move.

585
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,734
Get lost!

586
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,736
I just

587
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,772
realised that I'm not worthy of you.

588
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,608
Senior, no.

589
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:45,242
Calm down!

590
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:45,976
Move!

591
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:46,944
Your sister's in a lot of trouble.

592
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,378
Please cooperate with us.

593
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,415
I don't know.

594
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,149
Calm down.

595
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,851
No, you can't.

596
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,119
Senior!
