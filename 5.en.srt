Nothing.

174
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,954
What are these signs for?

175
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,991
We've determined that
it's the victim's footprints.

176
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,792
The weird part is that...

177
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,193
We could only find

178
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,863
the witness' footprints near the victim.

179
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,398
There were no other footprints

180
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,333
around the victim.

181
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,535
But the victim didn't wear shoes.

182
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,772
Did you notice last night's moon, ADA?

183
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,273
Last night?

184
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,142
Last night was new moon tide.

185
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,670
The flood mark ended here.

186
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,938
The shoes were probably washed away.

187
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,916
The bottle didn't get washed away,

188
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,985
yet the shoes were gone.

189
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,854
The bottle was buried in the sand,

190
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,323
and shoes were normally
easier to get washed away.

191
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,058
Easier if it were sandals.

192
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,829
How do we confirm if the
footprints are the victim's?

193
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:43,930
Over there,

194
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,599
we found his scooter.

195
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,135
The footprints on the mat
matched his footprints.

196
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,763
Open the compartment,
let me take a look.

197
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:53,840
Agatha Christie's novel?

198
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,511
In my last victim's apartment,
there's a mystery novel too.

199
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,379
Bought from the same bookstore.

200
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,249
We don't have many
bookstores these days, right?

201
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,583
It can't be a coincidence.

202
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,958
Hello, DA.

203
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,764
Hello?

204
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,032
Dr. Chung?

205
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,368
I'm Chen Chin Peng's guardian.

206
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,104
I want inform you that
he has passed away.

207
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,772
The body was found this morning.

208
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,972
The police is still looking
into the cause of his death.

209
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,678
How could this happen?

210
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,746
I'm stunned as well.

211
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,114
Last night he told me that

212
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,749
he would come home late.

213
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,585
However, he didn't say
with whom he'd be with.

214
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,886
The police told me

215
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,489
to pay attention to his
classmates in therapy class.

216
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,057
What does that mean?

217
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,193
In your class...

218
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,628
There are already two deaths this month.

219
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,231
Isn't it peculiar?

220
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:13,620
DA Yang, Chen Chin Peng's
brother just left.

221
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,621
Then I'll head back to the office.

222
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:15,689
Okay, good work.

223
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,990
Thanks, good work.

224
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:21,728
Is the autopsy over?

225
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,863
Yes.

226
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,665
Why are you here?

227
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,935
I'm done with the receipts.

228
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,471
I want to ask if the cause of
death has been determined yet.

229
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,740
Suicide by poison.

230
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,110
His family also agreed that he was suicidal.

231
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,080
He committed suicide?

232
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,082
The footage showed that

233
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,885
he drove to the beach by himself.

234
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,620
Only his fingerprints were on the bottle.

235
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,755
And there's only one set
of footprints on the beach.

236
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,056
What could it be if not suicide?

237
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:53,593
But Sir,

238
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,428
he went to the taxi driver's house.

239
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,863
Did you know?

240
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,399
I have the video.

241
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,036
- Sir.
- Today is our anniversary,

242
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:05,672
so I miss you even more.

243
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,841
Where did you get this video?

244
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,376
A resident there filmed it.

245
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,779
How did you know he went
to the taxi driver's house?

246
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,018
The taxi driver's autopsy last time...

247
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,486
I was there too, right?

248
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,454
Then I saw the news on TV,

249
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,089
and I coincidentally was
having dinner around the area.

250
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,724
I happened to get this video.

251
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,493
I didn't know it was Chen Chin Peng

252
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,829
until this morning at the scene.

253
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,164
Sir,

254
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,099
are these two cases connected?

255
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,804
Why did Chen Chin Peng went to Kuo
Chung Ren's house. That, I don't know.

256
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,773
Maybe they already knew each other.

257
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,442
Ask digital forensics to check
their phones and we'll know.

258
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,246
The problem is,
what does this video prove?

259
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,615
You don't even know when it's filmed.

260
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,950
It's filmed the day

261
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,351
the taxi driver died.

262
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,953
There's time stamp on the video.

263
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,222
Are you saying...

264
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:59,659
Chen Chin Peng might have
murdered Kuo Chung Ren?

265
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,394
Then why did he kill himself?

266
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,142
I don't know.

267
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,699
Sir...

268
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,868
The DA needs to go back to the office.

269
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,402
This is not the place to talk.

270
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,504
Auntie Chi Hui, I...

271
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:11,805
Let's go.

272
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,812
Sir...

273
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,513
Wait...

274
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,817
How did the media know where Kuo lived?

275
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,219
Who leaked it?

276
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,455
No...

277
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,659
What news did you see?

278
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,760
Just by watching the news,

279
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,796
you could identify it's Kuo's house?

280
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,900
The door looked similar.

281
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,204
They all look alike.

282
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,106
You were just guessing?

283
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:50,377
Sorry, I was just guessing?

284
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,314
You...

285
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,100
- Chun Yi.
- Teacher.

286
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,836
Is this your phone?

287
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,745
Yes.

288
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,575
How did you get it?

289
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,911
I found it in his house.

290
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:26,713
Did you leave any trails?

291
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,948
Did anyone see you?

292
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,683
No.

293
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,834
That's good.

294
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,102
I didn't expect you to get it so soon.

295
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,623
Teacher.

296
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,492
Now it's my turn to ask for a favor.

297
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,194
Sure, tell me about it.

298
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,265
I was thinking...

299
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,801
Could I transfer to your community therapy?

300
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:53,807
It's a bit difficult.

301
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,076
The rule says that

302
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,778
if I've treated you in jail
I can't treat you again when you're out.

303
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,781
Rules are just rules.

304
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,416
You must have ways around it.

305
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,557
Sure, I'll check for you

306
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,893
who is your designated therapist
allocated by the Health Bureau.

307
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,595
Teacher.

308
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,764
I've checked before.

309
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,399
He is very difficult.

310
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,900
You must take me.

311
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:25,538
It's the rule, I can't just...

312
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,041
Rules are man-made.

313
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,075
Teacher,

314
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,479
when you asked me to find your phone...

315
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,816
I found ways to do it.

316
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,686
Besides,

317
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:43,023
there are so many things on your phone.

318
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,825
If people were to see them...

319
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,598
The ball's in your court.

320
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,803
You saw them?

321
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,575
I have to.

322
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,711
Otherwise how would I know it's yours.

323
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,150
I like you, teacher.

324
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,452
And you've been nice to me.

325
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,020
Let's help each other out.

326
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:16,923
Call me.

327
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,680
How could you do this?

328
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,849
When did you start secretly reading the files?

329
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,317
Auntie, sorry.

330
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,053
Lin Mu Chin, this is very serious!

331
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,823
Reading investigation files without
permission is illegal, do you know!

332
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,358
When I saw that white board at your desk,

333
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,660
I knew it was bad news!

334
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,628
Didn't know you would investigate

335
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,931
things you shouldn't be investigating!

336
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,900
And flaunt around in front of the DA.

337
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,669
Are you using your brain at all?

338
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,772
Maybe the DA would think I'm in on it too.

339
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,774
Please, before you act on anything,

340
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,844
please think with your brain!

341
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,212
Everything on that whiteboard,

342
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,680
wipe it clean!

343
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,014
Wipe it away quickly!

344
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,687
Lin Mu Chin!

345
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,355
What have you done?

346
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,890
DA Yang said that he
won't work with you anymore.

347
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,992
And he wanted to tighten security on files.

348
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,427
What happened?

349
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,162
Nothing.

350
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,498
It's fine now, don't worry.

351
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,433
Are you sure?

352
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,204
As long as it's fine.

353
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,539
Go back to work.

354
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,416
Manager, can I have the afternoon off?

355
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,435
Dad!

356
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,206
Why did you come?

357
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,542
No overtime today?

358
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:16,876
I ended work early today.

359
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,246
You just started out,

360
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,582
it's weird not to have overtime.

361
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,588
I haven't had a break in a while, I'm exhausted.

362
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,756
I'll carry them for you.

363
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:33,993
Don't bring so much things next time.

364
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,629
I'm normally busy with work.
I have no time to eat at all.

365
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,867
You can give them to your colleagues.

366
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,947
What? Somebody bullied you?

367
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,984
No.

368
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,856
You are talking to
a seasoned detective now.

369
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:13,314
I'm after a murder case
of my own accord,

370
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:15,216
but the DA didn't believe me.

371
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,575
Did you find anything?

372
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,943
Any suspects?

373
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:24,944
Yes!

374
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,181
A gang member?

375
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,717
No, I don't think he even has a gun.

376
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,221
No guns?

377
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,993
Any evidence?

378
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:42,095
I have no evidence.

379
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:48,201
I'm a newbie, nobody would help me.

380
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,905
But my instinct tells me
there's something fishy about him.

381
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,109
Back then when we used to
play deduction games,

382
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,944
we would find some clues here,

383
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,145
and some evidence there.

384
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,981
Then, we would piece
everything together in the end.

385
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,950
But this time I couldn't even piece...

386
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:14,761
I was a criminal police for so long.

387
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,996
Do you know what I trust the most?

388
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,435
Instincts.

389
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,337
What are instincts?

390
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:27,432
Instincts are the experiences you accumulate

391
00:23:27,432 --> 00:23:30,109
from all the cases you work on.

392
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,879
Once you have them,

393
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,747
nobody can take them away.

394
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:39,452
Okay.

395
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,387
I'm leaving.

396
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,189
You're not staying?

397
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,791
You can sleep in my room,

398
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,359
I'll sleep on the sofa.

399
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,162
I'm meeting my friends.

400
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:52,365
I've sat here for so long,

401
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,501
and you didn't even offer me water.

402
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,303
Wait, let me boil water.

403
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:00,774
Sit down for a bit.

404
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,279
No need to hustle.

405
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,548
You take care.

406
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:09,716
I'm leaving.

407
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,615
Hey, Chu.

408
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:44,317
Long time no see.

409
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,552
Hey Lan, long time no see.

410
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,321
Nothing important,

411
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:52,291
just an ADA came to me.

412
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,027
ADA?

413
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,397
The ADA asked me about the mystery club.

414
00:24:57,397 --> 00:24:59,198
I told her about

415
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,734
the experiment at the time.

416
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,904
I was afraid the seniors would mind.

417
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:06,406
Okay, I got it.

418
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,476
Do you remember Chu
who joined the mystery club with me?

419
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,677
He just contacted me.

420
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,814
He said that there's an
ADA called Lin Mu Chin

421
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:18,084
found him at school and asked about
what happened back then at the mystery club.

422
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,752
He said he didn't reveal too much.

423
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,921
He just wanted you guys to know about it.

424
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:25,158
But why would the ADA
ask Chu about the club?

425
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:28,461
I got a new flavor for you today.

426
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:29,896
Less chemical-y.

427
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,264
You would like it.

428
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,234
How was it?

429
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,438
Quite good.

430
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,507
I need to go to the toilet.

431
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:42,507
Okay.

432
00:25:58,926 --> 00:25:59,957
Hey, Lan.

433
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:02,829
You said Chu talked to the ADA.

434
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,231
Did he say anything else?

435
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,304
Okay, that's all.

436
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:12,472
I'll call you later.

437
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:19,745
Hello, ADA.

438
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,282
What's up? Looking for books?

439
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,884
Looking for you.

440
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,286
Why?

441
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,196
Gonna arrest me?

442
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,424
You never lock your doors.

443
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,492
If a thief breaks in one day,

444
00:26:32,492 --> 00:26:34,594
you would wish that it's me instead.

445
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,967
I'm here to apologize

446
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,369
for snooping around last time.

447
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,438
About the matchbox...

448
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,474
It's fine.

449
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,776
Did the matchbox help with the case?

450
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:52,912
Actually, no.

451
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:54,647
Plus that's not my case.

452
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,048
My superior warned me

453
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,217
to stop messing with other people's cases.

454
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,752
Was it interesting?

455
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:00,953
Quite interesting.

456
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,922
Some of it resembled a mystery novel.

457
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,357
But my superior didn't get it.

458
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:06,592
Really?

459
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:08,594
So...

460
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,097
Can you share more?

461
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,565
Of course not.

462
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:14,600
But...

463
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,037
If I tell it as a story...

464
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:21,507
Then treat it as story telling.

465
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,042
We have a gathering tonight,

466
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,343
wanna join?

467
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,811
Really? Me?

468
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,381
My friends would be intrigued.

469
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:30,483
Let's make a deal first,

470
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,717
I'll just be observing on the side.

471
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,486
And I can't talk about the case,

472
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,921
I can only tell a story.

473
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,989
I know.

474
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,866
Trainer, are your people fighting outside?

475
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,570
What are they doing?

476
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,104
Stay away from Chi,

477
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,639
- get it?
- What do you mean?

478
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,675
- Do I need to call the police?
- How is Chi your concern?

479
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,716
Chi's my girlfriend, don't pretend!

480
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,248
Help me, what are you doing?

481
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,316
Get lost!

482
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,817
Stop it!

483
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:07,987
Call the police.

484
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,155
Stop it!

485
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,626
Chang Chi Hon,
what are you doing?

486
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,063
Stop it! Don't fight anymore!

487
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,044
Gi Chun Ting, stop it.

488
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,637
Stop acting...

489
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,206
- Stop it!
- Enough!

490
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:29,908
I've called the police.

491
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,536
Are you okay?

492
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:32,945
Still moving!
What are you doing?

493
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,513
You watch out!

494
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:41,954
Chen Chin Peng.

495
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,624
He has a record of sexual assault,
currently on probation.

496
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,193
You're selling this brand of beer?

497
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:50,730
You know this brand?

498
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,065
My friend gave it to me to try.

499
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,967
I'm still considering whether
I want to order it or not.

500
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,402
Do you think it tastes good?

501
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,237
I've never tried it before.

502
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,305
Try one.

503
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,141
Don't open it first.

504
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:03,643
I'm driving later.

505
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,845
Then take this bottle to try.

506
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:14,787
One of your friends who did the
live streams with you gave you this?

507
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,222
Yes.

508
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,857
The psychiatrist.

509
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,995
So the thing is,
this is one of the stronger ones.

510
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,663
Like Trappist beer.

511
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:25,731
I-I've got stuff to do.

512
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,366
I need to go now,
see you tonight.

513
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,335
- 8 o'clock!
- Okay.

514
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:40,246
Dad?

515
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,347
Are you really okay?

516
00:29:50,347 --> 00:29:51,782
Is your heart hurting?

517
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:53,993
No... it's not painful.

518
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,728
Sorry to scare you.

519
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,597
It's fine, it's not my
first time meeting rogues.

520
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,103
You knew the boy standing by?

521
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,707
My friend's brother.

522
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:09,275
He studies in our center too.

523
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,447
We didn't fight.

524
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:17,950
He just got sick and fell down.

525
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,311
We went to help him up.

526
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:22,646
Also, I thought he said he
wasn't going to press charges?

527
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,024
Officer, excuse me.

528
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,059
I'm Chang Chi Hon's sister.

529
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,395
How far along are
you with the statement?

530
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,799
You're still going to work
despite feeling unwell?

531
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,603
Yes.

532
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:38,883
My boss seems to trust me.

533
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:40,005
So he often asks me

534
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,941
to do all kinds of ad-hoc work.

535
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,877
Okay, go quickly then.

536
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,511
I need to go back to work too.

537
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,546
Take care of yourself.

538
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,564
Okay.

539
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:49,983
- Bye.
- Bye.

540
00:30:56,956 --> 00:31:00,589
I just had dinner with auntie Chi Hui.

541
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:01,824
She praised you.

542
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,099
She said that you are a natural,

543
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,034
and you have a bright future ahead.

544
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,315
Auntie Chi Hui, these are fruits of the season.

545
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,584
Very fresh, should be tasty.

546
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,021
I told you not to be so polite.

547
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,690
It's not being polite.

548
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,959
I've really troubled you a lot.

549
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,521
Dad told me,

550
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,023
you didn't complain about me.

551
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,701
I know you knew you were wrong.

552
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,606
Did DA Yang say anything else?

553
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,842
No...
He has his own temper.

554
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:51,477
It comes and goes in a huff.

555
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,112
Maybe he's already forgotten.

556
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,447
That's good.

557
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:58,017
I'll be more cautious next time, sorry.

558
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,853
It's fine, good girl.

559
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,721
So silly, it's fine!

560
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,366
Can you grow up?

561
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,004
I know.

562
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,441
I'm gonna take a shower.

563
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:35,221
Let me ask you.

564
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,156
When did Kuo Chun Yi get out?

565
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,894
Probably not long ago.

566
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:43,996
Did he come to you?

567
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,130
Yes.

568
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:47,458
Why would I voluntarily find him?

569
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,305
Did he ask you to steal the medicine?

570
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,213
No.

571
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:03,282
I know why you stole the medicine.

572
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,786
It's none of your business.

573
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,993
Are you doing drugs again?

574
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:20,099
No, I haven't done
that for a long time.

575
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,433
It's true.

576
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:23,869
Okay.

577
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,641
I'm just making some extra cash.

578
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,975
Anyway,

579
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,278
even if I don't sell it,
someone else will.

580
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:39,652
You said you're not doing drugs,
I believe in you.

581
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:41,720
But don't lie to me again.

582
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,724
These are expired drugs.

583
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:47,326
Take them if you need them.

584
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Goose!

585
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,882
I thought you weren't coming today.

586
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,852
What happened to your brother?

587
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,655
So annoying.

588
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:17,790
I just lectured him,

589
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,692
don't know if he would behave.

590
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:21,919
What if he does drugs again?

591
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,120
It's gonna be a mess.

592
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:27,833
I was thinking...

593
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,668
Wei's new friend,

594
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,537
isn't she an ADA?

595
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,038
Maybe I can ask her

596
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,940
what I can do with my brother.

597
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,518
What?

598
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,953
I've got stuff to do at home.

599
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,656
Shut up, park your car.

600
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:52,424
Hurry.

601
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,331
Hi Wei.

602
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,866
Let me introduce you.

603
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,201
This is Wen Tsu Yen.

604
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:03,669
This is Chang Ting Lan.

605
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,838
She's ADA Lin Mu Chin.

606
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:07,706
She works at the DA's office nearby.

607
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,209
My dad and I used to
play deduction games too.

608
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,810
I've been hooked on it
ever since I started.

609
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,112
Nice to meet you guys.

610
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:14,313
Nice to meet you too.

611
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,448
Really, I'm not lying to you guys.

612
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,649
We are agents.

613
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,184
Excuse me...

614
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,022
Move a little.
Come.

615
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,090
Give them your business card first.

616
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,658
Come. Sit here.

617
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,062
I have business cards here.

618
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:32,765
I'm friends with the owner here.

619
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:33,932
If you're interested,

620
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,100
I can introduce you.

621
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,443
Catch.

622
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:47,980
Bottle, footprints, perfume, poison.

623
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,782
Agatha Christie's "Five Little Pigs".

624
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:51,016
So quick!

625
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,553
It's just a piece of cake to our mystery club.

626
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:56,622
As per usual,

627
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:58,424
you need to tell us a story

628
00:35:58,424 --> 00:35:59,892
for us to deduct.

629
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,127
Okay.

630
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,196
But disclaimer,

631
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,798
what I say is pure fiction.

632
00:36:05,798 --> 00:36:07,800
Okay, okay... you may start.

633
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:13,647
A body was found at the beach.

634
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:15,541
There's only one set of footprints

635
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,142
going to the direction of the beach.

636
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,610
The shoes are gone.

637
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,313
There's a bottle of
poisoned beer beside him.

638
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,085
Are you sure he's
killed by the poison?

639
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:26,585
Yes.

640
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,587
The police thinks it's suicide,

641
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,522
because only his fingerprints
were found on the bottle.

642
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,491
And there are only one set of footprints.

643
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:38,530
How do you prove it's the victim's footprints?

644
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,933
They matched the footprints on his scooter mat.

645
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,863
But the shoes are gone...

646
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:47,531
That's weird.

647
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,242
Why did he take off the shoes?

648
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,412
Maybe in the last moments of his life,

649
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:56,014
he wanted to feel the texture of the sand.

650
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,453
The police thinks that the shoes
were washed away by the waves.

651
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,622
It was spring tide that night.

652
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,291
Maybe the killer

653
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,860
deliberately picked that day,

654
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,163
so that there will be an
explanation for the missing shoes.

655
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:17,102
So you all think it's not suicide?

656
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,774
Suicide would be too boring.

657
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,344
Great, that's what I thought too.

658
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,114
The question is how to explain

659
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:29,149
the only set of footprints
and fingerprints.

660
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:41,927
I have a theory for the footprints.

661
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:48,267
The murderer followed the victim.

662
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:52,938
He stepped on the victim's
footprints to get to the beach.

663
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,740
When the victim died,

664
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,975
he wore the victim's shoes

665
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,211
while holding his own,

666
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,146
and walked backwards

667
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,215
on the existing footprints.

668
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:04,550
Then it's done.

669
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,755
Was there beer left in the bottle?

670
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,723
Sorry, I was late!

671
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:12,858
Wen.

672
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:19,097
Don't let Lan and Goose know
that you were questioned.

673
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:24,836
Chung Yun Wen,
what are you doing?

674
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,104
I'll go!

675
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,844
So weird, he already
got here but left again.

676
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,079
No idea.

677
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,448
Is that Dr. Chung?

678
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,749
How do you know?
